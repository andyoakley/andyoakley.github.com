This was way more complicated than it should be.


*** Multiple smartcards
Almost all of my machines have multiple smartcard readers or TPMs.

In =%HOME%\AppData\Roaming\gnupg\scdaemon.conf=, add the line
#+BEGIN_SRC text
reader-port Yubico Yubikey Neo OTP+CCID 0
#+END_SRC

*** PuTTy support
In =%HOME%\AppData\Roaming\gnupg\gpg-agent.conf=, add the line
#+BEGIN_SRC text
enable-putty-support
#+END_SRC

*** Key generation
This part was largely directed by Simon Josefsson's post [[http://blog.josefsson.org/2014/06/23/offline-gnupg-master-key-and-subkeys-on-yubikey-neo-smartcard/][Offline GnuPG Master Key and Subkeys on YubiKey NEO Smartcard]]. The basic steps are:

1. Generate a key
2. Create subkeys for signing, encryption and authentication
3. Move the three subkeys to the Yubikey


*** Stub generation
