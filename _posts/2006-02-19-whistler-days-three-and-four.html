<div>Breakfast was somehow forgotten yesterday amidst the excitment of the journey up to the Blackcomb Glacier. The run from the top to the foot of the Excelerator lift is about 7km, with three of those on a cat track curling back around the mountain. We made good time up there (T-bar ride and all) and although there was a lot more snow than last year, it was decidedly icier. But still a great ride. Several runs later and we were all ready to take down lunch. I ate well.</div><div>�</div><div>Dave and I peeled away in the afternoon given the day three aches were starting to set in. We met up with Sean and Eric again at the bottom of the mountain and rode the never-ending gondola back up to the top of Whistler. A very leisurely ride back down ended the day nicely. Somehow my mid afternoon nap turned into a whole nights sleep and I missed the late night expedition to Dusty's bar in Creekside.</div><div>�</div><div>Well rested and�faring a little better than the rest of the party, breakfast time was upon us. A big eat in Dusty's was the perfect start to day four. I went solo for the morning and although the weekend had brought more people to the mountain, the conditions were much the same and I had a few good rides on Whistler and a quick stop in the village. We all met up for lunch at the top of Blackcomb and then played around in 7th Heaven for a few great runs before heading back to the base. The last ride out via the Dave Murray run seemed like the best we've had; the snow had seemingly melted a fair amount of the top snow and the machines too had done their part. By chance, we all came in together and that brings us to now. I believe an outing to the village is on the horizon.</div><div>�</div><div>I posted some more pictures and a couple of videos in the same place,�<a href="http://www.andyoakley.com/mypictures/default.aspx/snowboarding at whistler (feb 2006)">Snowboarding at Whistler (Feb 2006),</a> including one of�<a href="http://www.andyoakley.com/mypictures/default.aspx/snowboarding at whistler (feb 2006)/VCLP0195.avi">Dave getting some air</a>.</div>
