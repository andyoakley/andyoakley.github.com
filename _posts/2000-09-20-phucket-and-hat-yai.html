<p><i>Taken from Lauren's diary of our trip to South East Asia</i></p><p>Got up. Had breakfast and packed up. We paid and were left at the airport, Phucket International. We flew to Hat Yai in the south of Thailand via Trang. We got picked up and brought to the JB Hotel which is nice. We were dropped off at the train station so we could buy tickets to Penang for tomorrow morning, but we wouldn't buy them in advance. The train station was yuk, with lots of yuk people hanging around it. We walked around a bit - Hat Yai is not very nice. We found a McDonalds and had some food. We walked more (still yuk) and went into an internet cafe close to our hotel. We sent an e-mail home. Back to the hotel (phew). Showered. Dinner in the Jazz Bistro in the hotel and a good band (New Wave Band).</p>
