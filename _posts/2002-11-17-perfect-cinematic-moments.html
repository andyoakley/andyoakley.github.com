<p>One aspect of films that I hugely appreciate is a well thought out scene. When the imagery, soundtrack and dialog all align perfectly, it makes for a very moving moment. Invariably, this is where the emotions of the viewer reach the most intense point, whether it results in tears or bursts of joy is somewhat secondary.</p><p>It's rare that such moments occur in real life; indeed, I recall very few such cases that I have been privileged to experience, and then, only by accident. Sadly these moments simply cannot be conveyed by words alone, but I'll try.</p><p>One has just occurred. While listening to 'Somewhere over the Rainbow' in my apartment, a nasty three car wreck happened at the intersection below. Within seconds, there were just two things: the music and the deafening wail of emergency sirens.</p><p>Another moment than sticks in my mind happened while I was working at <a href="http://www.bridgemere.co.uk/">Bridgemere Garden World</a>. Late one evening, I vividly recall the rain pounding down on the plastic roof, drowning out all other sounds but one - the endless ringing of an unanswered phone. </p><p>This is a little deep for a Sunday morning.</p>
