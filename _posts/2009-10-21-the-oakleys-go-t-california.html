Last Sunday, Amy's parents hosted a post-wedding reception for us in California. Marking the end of what has been almost a year of celebration, we had a great time and I had the chance to put a lot of familiar names to actual faces.

Eve, everyone's favorite Food Network star, did a fabulous job with the cake and posted some pictures on her site at <a href="http://www.evesamonsky.com/the-oakleys">Eve Samonsky</a>. Jen made a <a href="http://www.rockyou.com/show_my_gallery2.php?instanceid=154162336">small photo gallery</a> too.

We flew back early on Monday morning, precisely one year after I asked the question. It has been a whirlwind of a year but I wouldn't have given it up for anything.
