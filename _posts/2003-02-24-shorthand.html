<p>Working in an environment where acronymns are a tradition, if not a religion, I've happily embraced their day to day use. It may well be violating all laws of pronunciation and letter placement, but just think of all those precious seconds I'm saving.</p><p>Shorthand in e-mail is a whole other deal. I'm still at a loss at to why people write u instead of you, w/ instead of with, mtg instead of meeting and the like. Can it really take that much longer to type properly? Maybe my inner monologue doesn't work like other people's, but I read w/ as 'wuh' and the sentence never ends up making sense.</p><p>Yes, I believe I am a hypocrite.</p>
