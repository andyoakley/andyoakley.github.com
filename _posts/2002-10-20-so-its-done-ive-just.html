<p>So it's done, I've just bought <b>brainmunchies.net</b>. Ah, the joys of whim.</p><p>On a more serious note, this evening I came across <a href="http://randomwalks.com/dayku/">DAYKU</a>, a thousand syllables for peace. It is indeed a relief to see that not the entire world has gone war crazy. I've been wanting to record my thoughts about Sen Robert Byrd too, he may be aging, but his stance is spot on.</p><p><div><i>&quot;I'm in my 50th year in Congress and I never thought I would find a Senate which lacks the backbone to stand up against this stampede, this rush to war, I think we are making one horrible mistake.&quot;</i><div align="right">Sen. Robert C. Byrd (D-W.Va.)</div></div></p><p>Two again today, but I'm feeling good about it. </p>
