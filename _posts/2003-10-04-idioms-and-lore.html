While listening to an old Morcheeba song, I started thinking about idioms and lore that have worked their way into English.I think Rome has the most: Everyone knows <a href="http://www.bartleby.com/59/3/allroadslead.html">all roads lead to Rome</a>, which <a href="http://www.bartleby.com/59/3/romewasntbui.html">wasn't built in a day</a>, and, <a href="http://www.bartleby.com/59/3/wheninromedo.html">when in Rome</a> <a href="http://www.bartleby.com/59/4/fiddlewhiler.html">apathy burns strong</a>.What an honor, to be immortalized in language.
