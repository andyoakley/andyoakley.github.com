This is actually quite an old video (2003) but remains highly relevant. Provide ready access to large quantities of information and the ideas will follow.
<blockquote>But I think it's very important to have all this information.  We need really to see it...  In this software, we access about 500 variables from all the countries quite easily. It takes some time to change for this, but on the axises, you can quite easily get any variable you would like to have. And the thing would be to get up the databases free, to get them searchable, and with a second click, to get them into the graphic formats, where you can instantly understand them. Now, statisticians doesn't like it, because they say that this will not show the reality; we have to have statistical, analytical methods. <strong>But this is hypothesis-generating.</strong></blockquote>
