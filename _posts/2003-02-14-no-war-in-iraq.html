Well, Mr President, I am here to tell you, look around and you will see, the United Nations has done its duty&quot;.</p><p>Everyone had their own message, all had a common theme, from the simple 'No Iraq War', 'Impeach Bush' and 'Not in our name', to the more pointed 'Pearl Harbor was pre-emptive war' and 'Justice or Just Us'. There seemed to be universal support for the troops whatever happens, a significant difference from Vietnam, I suspect. Without doubt, there was a real cross section of people present, from the 'Raging Grannies' to the 'Whores not wars' crowd. As the chant goes: this is what democracy looks like.</p><p>Despite the significant <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/2765215.stm">global display</a> of public opinion, is that alone enough to change the path on which things are heading? I sincerely hope so.</p>
