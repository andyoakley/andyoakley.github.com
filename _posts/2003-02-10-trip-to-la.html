After the initial shock of the warm 80F temperatures and bright sunny skies, we got to see and do a lot of things in LA, including a day in <a href="http://www.disneyland.com">Disneyland</a> and a stroll down <a href="http://www.seeing-stars.com/Streets/HollywoodBlvd.shtml">Hollywood Boulevard</a>. </p><p>I can certainly see why every child in America dreams of (and usually does) visit a Disney resort at some point in their childhood, despite the fact that some of the rides are a little trippy at times if you think about it too much. I think the happiest place on earth is certainly happiest when there are no queues or waiting around, such as we enjoyed.</p><p>I think we were both expecting so much more from the Walk of Fame; I'm not sure exactly what, but we didn't find it in Hollywood. Still, nice to see the <a href="http://www.kodaktheatre.com/">Kodak Theater</a> with it's boards ready for the 2078 Best Picture winner. Having seen so much of LA on TV over the years (from the Oscars, to the cliche 'LAPD freeze!' in some many cop shows) I felt a strange sense of closure finally seeing things in person.</p><p>We stopped by Venice Beach on the way back to the airport too, which was nice, but a little windy and rather quiet. I can imagine it's a completely different story on a summer afternoon.</p><p>Overall, I'm still in awe of the sheer size of the city (even from the air, it went on for a very long way) but don't have the sudden urge to relocate to Southern California (which I'll admit, was a worry).</p><p>Both ways, the lack of food on the <a href="http://www.united.com/">United</a> flights was a mild concern, but was easily compensated by the fact that you can listen to air traffic control in flight. It's one of those 'features' I never thought would be remotely interesting until you have opportunity to listen. It's a shame more carriers don't broadcast it as a matter of course.</p>
