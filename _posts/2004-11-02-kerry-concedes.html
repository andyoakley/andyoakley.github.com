<p>Even with a number of outstanding provisional ballots in Ohio, the Kerry campaign has decided to not force a count of all votes given the current margin in that state. It's over. I've watched this race from early on, following the caucuses, the campaigns, the pollsters, the negative advertising (quite a novelty for an Englishman), the debates and the final hours. When it's all said and done, not only does the GOP remain in the White House, they also picked up seats in the House and Senate. This doesn't seem to reflect the world in which I've been living. I like Seattle just the way it is, comfortable yet reasonably liberal and while I don't expect that to change, it's clearly pretty different from the feeling in many other parts of the country.</p><p>What's in store for the next four years?</p>
