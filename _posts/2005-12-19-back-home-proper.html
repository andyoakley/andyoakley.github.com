<p>I was very impressed with the new Euston-Stoke train. Ignoring the cost (ï¿½44 does seem a list excessive for a 90 minute experience), the floating/banking motion does allow the train to move much more quickly (probably 80-90mph) and get from A to B more quickly. And I'm glad to be at B right now.</p><p>Home has seen some remodeling over the last year and is looking great. Some things have changed, others remain the same and I suppose that's the beauty of coming back after a long absence.</p>
