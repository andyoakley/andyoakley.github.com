<em>Taken from the Madagascar Team 1 Journal, originally by Oli</em>

This was the first day of our project work. In the morning, we went to the two sites on which we would be working. Basically, we were asked to construct plant boxes of 6m x 1m dimensions, using the local tools, which consisted of 2 spades per site, ad pitching forks which bent like rubber!

We drew up a time-table for our project work over lunch - it turned out that they only wanted us to do about 12 hours work over 5 days!! We started our plant boxes that afternoon, and my group, particularly, found it harder than it looked (we had to plough half a field with our hands before we could even start!!)

That evening, after a hot afternoon's work, what we all really wanted was a really hearty meal. Unfortuantely, Graeme and Sam's 'attempt' at cooking tasted like the bottom of the toilets looked!

PS. Since then, the apportion of the blame for this meal has been split as follows:24% - Sam and Graeme (chief chefs)25% - Mike (started it off badly)25% - Martin (should have been cooking)25% - Supplies (ie poor ingredients)1% - Dave (for stirring the rice)Sam and Graeme got off lightly by their own admission.
