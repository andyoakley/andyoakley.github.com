<p>The astute reader will have observed a slight reduction in posting frequency over the last ten months. </p> <p>Here is the short version for my own records. There may be some gaps.</p> <ul> <li>I have a fabulous girlfriend, Amy</li> <li>There is no improvement in my kickball skills</li> <li>My brother Dave came to visit in February and we did some skiing, some touring, some gambling&nbsp;and some eating.</li> <li>I signed up for both MySpace and Facebook and then entirely failed to use either</li> <li>I have the Seattle Times delivered every Sunday and read most of it. <a href="http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/living/rantrave.html">Never the rants, always the raves</a>.</li> <li>I took&nbsp;a vacation in Flagstaff, AZ and a trip to the Grand Canyon&nbsp;with my parents. Stunning place.</li> <li>I bought a digital SLR for the aforementioned trip and have been using it <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/apoakley/">frequently ever since</a>.</li> <li>I can now make pumpkin muffins, crusty french bread and pizza dough from raw ingredients.</li> <li>I survived the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/December_2006_Pacific_Northwest_storms">Great Seattle Wind Storm of 2006</a>.</li> <li>I try to work from home ever other Tuesday. It seems to only work out once a month, but it's good for getting things done.</li> <li>I commute by bus every day. This makes me feel better after having watched An Inconvenient Truth.</li> <li>Amy &amp; I went on a weekend&nbsp;vacation in South Lake Tahoe</li> <li>I bought a house in Seattle's U-District/Roosevelt/Ravenna area ('by Whole Foods' seems most accurate)</li> <li>A house's&nbsp;furnace doesn't just sound impressive, it actually heats the house. If it breaks down, the house cools down too. Try not to discover this in February.</li> <li>I now own my very own lawnmower. Mowing the lawn isn't as much fun when you're not earning pocket money for it.</li> <li>I wish Al Gore would run for president even though I can't vote.</li> <li>I made my first Craigslist purchase - a large, distressed dining table from Munroe</li> <li>I hosted my first Superbowl party, a tradition I hope to continue.</li> <li>I had another set of biometrics taken for my green card&nbsp;as apparently your fingerprints change every 18 months</li> <li>I had another two medical exams for my green card because a chest X-ray isn't sufficient to prove you don't have TB.</li> <li>I still don't have a green card after five and a bit years of waiting.</li></ul> <p>Other that these things, everything is almost precisely where I left it. </p> <p>Life is good.</p>
