<p>Just a few more things before I call it a night. I've a busy few weeks ahead with trips here and there. Next weekend I'll be in New York, meeting up with Bob Wilson to run the <a href="http://www.nycmarathon.org">marathon</a>. I've been training fairly well over the last few months, ramping up more recently and feeling fairly positive but I'm well aware it's still going to be a very long way. After that I'll be taking a forced vacation to Vancouver B.C. to get a new H1-B stamp (why oh why you need to leave the country to do this is beyond me) for a few days. Then it'll be Thanksgiving (might leave town for that) followed by a couple of guests spending some time in Seattle and then back to the UK over the holidays. </p><p>It'll be my first Christmas (Day) at home for four or five years and it's feeling long overdue.</p>
