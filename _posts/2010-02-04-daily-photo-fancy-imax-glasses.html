We saw Avatar this evening at an IMAX theater in Haidian. Despite having seen it once it was well worth returning to see it in full 3D. The Chinese subtitles did make it a bit hard to follow the Na'vi conversations but the plot isn't really a central part of the experience so I don't think we missed much.
