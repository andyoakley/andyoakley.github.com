Thanksgiving is probably my favorite time of year. It's an opportunity to slow down for a moment, reflect on how good things really are, and look forward to the times ahead.

Since I seem to think in bulleted lists these days, here are some of the things I'm grateful for:
<ul>
	<li><strong>A loving, caring, kind and thoughtful wife</strong>. I expect to be thankful for this one for a very long time to come.</li>
	<li><strong>Supportive family</strong>. With so many having made special trips this year to join us in Port Townsend, I'm reminded how important this is. Particularly also for my parents who also hosted a lovely reception for us in England. And of course the new set of people who I now also get to call family and their welcoming.</li>
	<li><strong>Friends. </strong>Life is much more fun with company and I'm reminded of the hospitality extended over the years to a young foreigner in a new city, especially over the holidays.</li>
	<li><strong>Employment</strong>. It may not always be easy but I enjoy what I do and know that it's not been an easy year employment-wise for many.</li>
</ul>
Today itself has been been rather great as well, including many of my favorite things.
<ul>
	<li><strong>Nespresso</strong>. Coffee continues to be a vital enabler.</li>
	<li><strong>Whole Foods. </strong>Holding the title of Mayor on Foursquare for the local store may be taking it a bit far but they just have so many tasty things.</li>
	<li><strong>Turkey, football </strong>and one of those entirely overwhelming, immensely satisfying <strong>nap</strong> after a delicious meal.</li>
	<li><strong>Feel good, family movies</strong> on TV.</li>
</ul>
Life is good.
