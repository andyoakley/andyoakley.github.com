<p>I'm a bit behind the times on this one but I just finished reading The Da Vinci Code by Dan Brown. Absolutely fantastic book; thoroughly recommended. Despite not reading all that much fiction, I've hardly been able to put this one down. I love a good thriller/thinker. </p><p>The whole idea of carrying forward a story for hundreds of years really makes one question what we're doing in the here and now is all that significant. Policy demands work e-mail gets purged every few months and phone calls and web chats have replaced traditional hold-in-your-hand letters (aside from the much appreciated ones from my mother :)). The proliferation of digital photos (and the as many as you can take option that comes with) offsets this a little, but still, it's a little scary.</p>
