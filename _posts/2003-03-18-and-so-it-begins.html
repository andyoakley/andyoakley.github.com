As expected, the markets rallied today, which makes no sense to me: war - happy investors, no war - happy investors, uncertainty - cautious investors, bad for the stock market. Since both outcomes seem to make them happy, how should uncertainty matter?</p><p>Meanwhile, regular TV programming was mostly scrapped this evening, giving way to shows like 'When democracy fails'. The news people all seem very excited to finally be using their prepared maps, animations and mini-reports that have clearly been sitting in waiting for a while.</p><p>It will be very interesting to see how journalism comes across live and uncensored from the front lines (as the US armed forces policy now supports). Technology now opens up a very new experience, being placed in the middle of the action while in the comfort of home. It's bound to have an effect on public opinion, but I'm not sure which way just yet.</p><p>In other news, Natalie Maines of Dixie Chicks fame makes a <a href="http://www.msnbc.com/local/knop/m279621.asp">supreme misjudgment</a> over peoples sensitivity to remarks about their president.

And as if that wasn't enough the <a href="http://abcnews.go.com/sections/GMA/Living/GMA030317Mystery_illness_alert.html">puzzling illness</a> currently vexing scientists would normally be huge news, but has been made insignificant by other happenings. Let's hope it stays that way.</p>
