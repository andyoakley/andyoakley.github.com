<p>Seems it's not only Seattle seeing the <a href="http://blog.andyoakley.com/2008/07/28/sudden-rise-in-seattle-graffiti-is-the-economy-to-blame/">rising trend in tagging</a>. The <a href="http://kirklandweblog.typepad.com/kirkland_weblog/2008/07/go-away-taggers.html">Kirkland Weblog</a> reports an increase on the East side too.</p> <p>I am impressed that police departments log every reported tagging event. Combined with some local population information, I wonder what some basic data mining might turn up.</p> <p>Useful links:</p> <ul> <li><a href="http://www.seattle.gov/util/services/Garbage/Reduce_Garbage_&amp;_Litter/Graffiti_Prevention_&amp;_Removal/COS_002178.asp">Seattle graffiti reporting hotline</a>. 206-684-7587.</li> <li>The <a href="http://www.seattle.gov/util/Services/Garbage/Reduce_Garbage_&amp;_Litter/Graffiti_Prevention_&amp;_Removal/GRAFFITIN_200312041629544.asp">Graffiti Nuisance Ordinance</a> 'encourages the rapid cleanup of graffiti [...] to prevent its spread through the community'</li></ul>
