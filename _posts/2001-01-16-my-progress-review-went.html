My progress review went fine. Did my first erg of the term, which was nice. Managed the first 2k in 7:00 which bodes well I guess.<br /><p>Formal hall tonight should be fun, despite the fact I'm both tired after doing exercise and stiff from circuits yesterday.<br /><p>I have been innundated with e-mails today asking about the obvious, but not to worry. I've had two from Cendant Mobility with a list of websites about <a href="http://seattle.citysearch.com">Seattle</a>. The <a href="http://www.new2usa.com">new2usa</a> site seems pretty good although rather slow. Particularly useful I thought was the <a href="http://www.new2usa.com/showpage.jsp?PageID=society-080700-01">Football basics</a> page with some help for beginners on the in's and out's of American Football. One I must read I think.
