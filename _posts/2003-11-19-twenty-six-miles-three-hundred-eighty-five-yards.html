Bob quietly posted something in my comments that is worthy of note. <blockquote>Don't forget a commitment to running the New York City Marathon in 2004 - registration starts in Januray <a href="http://www.nyrrc.org/nyrrc/marathon/generalinfo/nyrr.html">http://www.nyrrc.org/nyrrc/marathon/generalinfo/nyrr.html</a></blockquote>Quite right. Those twenty six and a little bit miles between Windsor Castle and the Royal Box laid down the challenge. The time has come; I've been comfortably doing a few 3-4 mile runs for several weeks now and there's just under a year to get into shape. Yes Bob, this will happen.
