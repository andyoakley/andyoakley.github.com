This isn't a weblog, I'm just not good/disciplined/free enough to record and link to relevant web content (<a href="http://www.brainmunchies.net">brainmunchies</a> is the closest to that). This is a journal. The distinction is purely artifical, but after finishing <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0345342968/104-8062563-3759900?vi=glance">Fahrenheit 451</a> I'm feeling scared we'll forget everything if it's not written down. In truth, it would probably work the other way around - too much information that the importance of certain things gets lost. Embedded reporting fuelled the warnography craze for a while and now it's the Scott Peterson trial that the most important event of the moment. The irony is there - on the one hand I could complain about only ever getting a single point of view (that of the reporter), on the other I perceive the subject matter to be far more important than it really is (several vocal points of view, none of which necessarily agree).
