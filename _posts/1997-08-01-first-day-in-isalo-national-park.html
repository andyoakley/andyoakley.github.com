<em>Taken from the Madagascar Team 1 Journal, originally by Oli</em>

After a fairly leisurely get-up, I took over the leader's whistle from Catherine, at about 10.00 am. As we left the Hotel Lemurien (seemingly the local haunt of the towns cockroach population) and headed for Isalo National Park, I was expecting this to be the highlight of the expedition.

We stopped for lunch at midday, when we arrived at a beautiful spot by a river and took ample time to consume and digest our french loaves with various fillings. After an extended dinner break, we set off at about 2.00 pm. It proved to be a comparatively easy day, as we covered 12 km in roughly 5 hours, including lunch. This meant we arrived at the campsite just about 3.00 pm. It was superbly situated under a cluster of Mangrove trees and was like a gateway into the canyons.

After the customary task of tent-erection, Graeme, Sam and myself decided to venture into the Canyon des Singes (pronounced sinj!). It proved worthwile, as we were suddenly encapsulated in a hidden paradise. Following a good half-hour's exploration, we were swiftly persuaded to return o base camp, by what sounded like the deranged warblings of a drowning beast!

Although we were impressed with our adventure, on returning, the rest of Madagascar Team One seemed more concerned with removing jiggers from their feet! Mike amassed a formidable total of 3 jiggers (one of which was apparently a beast) while Martin and Nanah proved themselves worthy jigger surgeons. A career in medicine surely beckons for them both.

And so dusk fell, with great discretion. With the night came a chill and with the chill out cam ethe recently purchased Malagasy rugs. As we polished off another fine meal (disturbed only by a hairy caterpillar, trying to crush our high spirits by stinging Werthers; who coped valiantly) a storm brewed in the distance. We were able to watch the lightning, miles away, piercing the grey skies, safe in the knowledge that our rugs would protect us!
