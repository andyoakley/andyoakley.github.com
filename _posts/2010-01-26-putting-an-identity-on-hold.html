<strong>Paperless billing. </strong>This makes remote management much, much easier. And reduces the number of paper bills on return too.

<strong>Vacation modes for cell phones.</strong> Having accounts with both AT&amp;T and Verizon, it turns out that you can call them up and ask them to put your account on vacation suspend. There's a nominal charge, I think AT&amp;T is $10/mo while Verizon is $15 flat, and that's all you pay. Your contract end date is pushed out accordingly but you can keep the account on suspend for 180 days (or 90+90 in the case of Verizon). It did, however, make me realize quite how much we spend on 'bandwidth' every month.

<strong>Canceling cable. </strong>Having a no-contract arrangement with Comcast made this part really easy. I might even get special introductory six-month pricing on return.

<strong>Credit card travel info. </strong>This was a mixed bag. Some cards were set up well and you just give them a start and end date and that's it. Others tell you to call back each month to 'remind' them. Sigh. Still, I'm certain that's better than a stop in cash flow.

<strong>Car insurance. </strong>It seems you can get reduced rates for vehicles if you're not actively driving them.
