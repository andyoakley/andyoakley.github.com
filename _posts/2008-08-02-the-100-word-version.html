<p>I wouldn't exactly say I'm proud of reading Valleywag on a regular basis. It's not so much the brainwashed feeling that trashy journalism engenders as it is the wonder of what life would be like with that time instead dedicated to some of the more noble pursuits of western civilization.  <p>Ah yes, time. Perhaps their most valuable contribution is the 'hundred word version', an act of distilling down the long, meandering press releases and leaked e-mails into something more readily digestible.  <p>Itâ€™s a good thing to remember when writing: if you can say it in 100 words, why use more?</p>
