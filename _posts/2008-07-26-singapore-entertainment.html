<p>It's 7am on a Saturday morning and I'm wide awake as my body clock is still 15 hours ahead as I've spent the last week attending <a href="http://sigir2008.org/">SIGIR 2008</a> in Singapore.</p> <p>The conference itself was interesting. Lots of papers to review, ideas, discussion and other activity. We crammed a lot of material into just five days but it was well worth the trip. The planned schedule was fairly tight (early mornings, full days and a day-full of e-mail still generated from Redmond overnight) but a group of us still managed to make room for some evening excursions.</p> <p><strong>Sunday night: </strong>Conference reception at the hotel followed by late drinks at Clarke Quay, a row of ex-pat-attracting bars along the waterfront.</p> <p><strong>Monday evening</strong>: A trip to the Singapore Zoo and its excellent <a href="http://www.nightsafari.com.sg/index.html">night safari</a>. I'm often skeptical of such ideas but this is really well done. No fences in sight, everything is separated by ditches and water but you feel quite close to the animals.</p> <p><strong>Tuesday evening</strong>: Conference banquet at the Rasa Sentosa Hotel, Siloso Beach which happens to be a small island off the small island of Singapore. Buffet dinner on the beach watching the huge cargo ships passing by.</p> <p><strong>Wednesday evening:</strong> Guided by one of our coworkers who grew up in Singapore, we went to Little India, the overwhelming <a href="http://www.mustafa.com.sg/index.asp">Mustafa Center</a>, outdoor dining at <a href="http://www.makansutra.com/eateries.html">Gluttons Bay</a> and a late walk to the Merlion.</p> <p><strong>Thursday night:</strong> Orchard Road mall-hopping followed by an all-you-can-eat buffet at the <a href="http://www.singapore.grand.hyatt.com/hyatt/hotels/entertainment/restaurants/index.jsp">Straits Kitchen</a> in the Hyatt (excellent!). </p> <p>All in all, a good trip. I am, however, very glad to be back in Seattle, free from the ceaseless humidity.</p>
