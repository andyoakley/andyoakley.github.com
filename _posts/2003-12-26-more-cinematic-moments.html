I've talked about <a href="http://www.andyoakley.com/archives/000069.html">cinematic moments</a> before. I have a couple more to add to the list.Yesterday, Christmas Day, morning, 9am. Not a person or car in sight in downtown Seattle. Almost complete peace, aside from a single soda can bouncing its way down First Ave (I watched it amble along maybe three or four blocks, it could have gone much further). An urban desert.With so many people currently on vacation, campus is really quiet and the cafeterias are running reduced hours. I just went over to Cafe 9 for a quick bite to eat and on entering, the place was empty. The wall mounted TVs were still on however, by chance showing a certain <a href="http://www-3.ibm.com/e-business/doc/content/lp/prodigy.html">IBM Linux commercial</a> 'what he learns we all learn', but no-one was there to see. A premonition of things to come? That would depend on who you talk to.
