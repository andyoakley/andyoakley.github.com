<p>Ugh. It really didn't take long for the 'back from vacation' feeling to fade to nothing more than a fleeting memory. Still, a week of vacation without travelling anywhere (a first!) is highly recommended.</p><p>Coming back to a mailbox with over 6000 new unread items from a four day week, it was clearly time to unjoin some distribution lists. A week without mail was bliss. I think I'll try peaceful ignorance over sheer volume for a while.</p>
