<p>My herbs appeared to be growing strong; they germinated quickly and looked to be growing steadily. I moved them to the window so that they'd have their required 6 hours of direct sunlight daily, but things aren't looking great. The sun never shines directly in Seattle.</p><p>Although they're not dying as such, I'm not sure they'll ever be edible. Sometimes I feel like I wither and wilt when I don't see daylight for long enough.</p>
