<em>Taken from the Madagascar Team 1 Journal, originally by Han</em>

Having had a rather bitty-type of a day to be leader on Sunday, it was decided that I had to be leader again on the Monday. As half the team wavedgood-bye to Oli (still assistant leader) and the supplies team who were going to Ifanadine to restock, I was faced with the task of making a three-roomed school house into something like home. In the morning, people were given freedom to do washing, wash themselves and generally relax. Which was nice. However, after lunch, more serious work began to develop in the form of shower building. Actually, the construction of the shower was totally male territory. No women were allowed in the vicinity unless she came bearing tea and biccies!! Meanwhile, the women's work in the school house consisted of clearing fllors of all baggge, sweeping and lugging school desks around the building. We managed, in about 2 hours, to turn the school's rooms into a rather homey place... and I think the men were secretly rather impressed. The male bonding round the back of the building (aka building a shower) was a mixed success. The blokes thoroughly enjoyed themselves... and the girls (namely Suzanne) had destroyed the show by the next morning!!
