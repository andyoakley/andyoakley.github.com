<p><i>Taken from Lauren's diary of our trip to South East Asia</i></p><p>We got up, had breakfast in the hotel, checked out and caught the bus to Kuala Lumpur (5 hours). We taxied to our hotel, The Capitol which was nice. We went for a walk, cashed some travellers cheques and ate in McDonalds. We wandered around a shopping centre and had some Haagen-Dazs ice cream. Back to the hotel. We went to a pizza restaurant near the hotel for dinner. We sent an e-mail home, returned to the hotel and watched &quot;The Green Mile&quot; on TV.</p>
