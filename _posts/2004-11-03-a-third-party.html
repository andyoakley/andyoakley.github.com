<p>Kerry calls Bush to congratulate him and then implores him to unify as�this country is fundamentally divided.�The two-party system asks individuals to categorize themselves as A or B, nothing else. While Nader doesn't get the blame this time around, he's still not the right person to represent the significant middle ground. It's not another candidate that's needed here, it's another party.</p>
