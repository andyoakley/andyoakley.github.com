<p>I just heard an interesting soundbite on the news from an interview with the President last Thursday.<blockquote>Reporter: If we do go to war...<br />George W Bush: (interrupting) Which country?</blockquote></p><p>Fair question, but it definitely reflects the rather troubling times at the moment. Growing nuclear tension with North Korea, an imminent war in Iraq, continuing violence in the Middle East, and a still uncertain state of 'homeland security' in the US, it's not looking great.</p>
