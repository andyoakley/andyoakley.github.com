<p>A great weekend that passed all too quickly. With the marathon now in the past, the opportunity to drink pleasant amounts of PBR was seized on Friday night and, combined with a little shuffleboard, made for a most entertaining evening. In a bar drinking beer with friends. Fun.</p><p>Katie and I went on an accidental trip on Saturday. What started off innocently enough as a trip to the market to get bread and cheese soon escalated to a drive to Mud Mountain Dam (out past Auburn and Kent), some logging-trail mountain ascent action and a sunset at Paradise on a cold Mt Rainier. A good day.</p><p>I did a little writing on Sunday and that was it.</p>
