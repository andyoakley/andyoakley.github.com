<p>I vividly remember the initial shock I felt on giving up the British media (brutal tabloids and all) for the comforts of CNN and MSNBC. Of late, that cynical sense of underlying bias seems to have mostly faded - while still reading the BBC, cable TV news is often far more convenient. I'm now at the point where I'd put down my fear of not hearing the whole story to differences in delivery and style.</p><p>Alas, it seems I'm becoming soft; while you can believe everything they tell you, it's <a href="http://www.takebackthemedia.com/news-cnnedit.html">what they leave out</a> that worries me.</p>
