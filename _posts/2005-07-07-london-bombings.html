<p>I've just arrived back in town from an overnight solo camping trip in the back of beyond to some rather shocking news from reality. The concern that's been lurking since 9/11 has been realized with <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/4661059.stm">four bombings in Central London</a>. 38 killed so far with hundreds injured. My condolences to anyone affected by this act.</p><p>It's bittersweet to learn at the same time that yesterday London won the bid for the 2012 Olympics. Well done to all invovled in making that happen. As Tony says, <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2005/WORLD/europe/07/07/blair.statement/index.html">&quot;we shall prevail and they shall not&quot;</a>ï¿½and I have confidence that the people of London will continue on with firm resolve.</p>
