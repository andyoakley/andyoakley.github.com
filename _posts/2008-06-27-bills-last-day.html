A lot of mixed feelings on campus today and an emotional town hall meeting this morning. Bill's departure won't make a material difference in day to day operations (that transition was figured out months if not years ago) but among those that work here, you'd have to look very hard to find anyone who doesn't thank billg for creating this culture and environment.

As an individual he's played the largest role in the industry over the last thirty years and in some sense he's not even half done and will go on to have an equally huge impact on the world with the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation.
