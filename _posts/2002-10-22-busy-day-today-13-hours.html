Atmosphere is a tricky one; loud music is out, but what if the place is silent? Perhaps a good opportunity to pipe muzak-people-babble through the sound system and see if anyone notices.</p><p>By chance, I listened to Three Lions by the Lightning Seeds this evening. American sports are all very well, but they just don't seem to invoke the real passion and spirit of a good game of football. I have a feeling I'm more English than I once thought. I'll live in London one day..</p>
