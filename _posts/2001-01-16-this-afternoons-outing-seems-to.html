This afternoon's outing seems to be beset with problems, first of all Tom A can't make it, so I was taking his place. Then Denis notices that he's actually quite ill after last night and also won't be able to row. Things look bleak until Andy M knocks on my door and offers, without even prompting. Strange how these things always turn out ok.<br /><p>Went to <b>Howes Cycles</b> and bought some new brake pads for my bicycle. I life expectancy has gone up by at least a few years (being able to stop before rolling into oncoming traffic is presumably a good thing, and one that insurance companies favour).
