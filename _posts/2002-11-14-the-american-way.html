<p>As I sit in my office sipping my fifth blended margarita, I've turned to reading some of the <a href="http://www.xbox.com/live/">Xbox</a> Live forums. The service officially launched today.</p><p>I wouldn't exactly describe myself as a cynic, but there's something about <a href="http://forums.xbox.com/ShowPost.aspx?PostID=149378">this post</a> that just couldn't go without mention.<div>Bill gates if you are listening. This week you dedicated 100 million dollars to some third world country filled with people dieing of aids. Well you should take care of the hand that feeds you first. Like the good old american consumers who buy computers with windows, who buy xboxs. Sure that 100 million dollars may save a few lives, but I think you owe it to us first. Take that money back and get us some dedicated game severs. This is an outrage!</div></p><p>Did I mention I love America?</p>
