<p>It started on the flight back, looking through the Skymall (or whatever it's called) magazine for duty free sales. This time I'm going to do it right. I'm going to make a list of the things I really miss living in the US and be sure to bring back a wholesome stash to ration until my next resupply.</p><ul><li>Chocolate. Obviously. Chocolate is made with lots of cocoa and not high fructose corn syrup. If you do it right, you end up with a piece of food that is milky, soft and tasty. If you do it wrong, you get candle wax. <ul><li>Smarties. Always liked them, especially because you get�a letter on the inside of the cap. <li>Dairy milk. Pretending it's Cadbury's while making it with Hershey's chocolate is inexcusable. <li>Mars bars. Useful as currency, among other things. <li>Curly wurly, twirl, double decker, time out, finger of fudge and all of the other�great chocolate bars that have yet to penetrate the world market.<li>Big tin of Roses. I just saw an advert on TV.</li></ul><li>HP Brown Sauce. How can a country that, in every restaurant,�has 5 salad dressings as standard neglect to include brown sauce in its cuisine. <li>Kingsmill. Probably difficult to take back effectively. I include it here in protest. <li>Twiglets. Very tasty. <li>IRN-BRU. Made from girders in Scotland. What more do I need to say? <li>Dandelion and burdock. I quite like the taste but�I think more that it's a miracle they ever managed to market a drink with this name. To be fair, this is hard to find in Britain as well. <li>Bacon. Low grade, fatty, streaky bacon shouldn't qualify for the 'bacon' moniker on any continent. Bacon should be salty, possibly smoked and comprise significantly more meat than fat. <li>Bangers. Sausages are just for breakfast you know. <li>Cherry bakewells, economy swiss rolls. Included for sentimental attachment.</li></ul><p>This list has been longer in the past. I have been fortunate to discover:</p><ul><li>Baked beans. QFC, Larrys and a handful of other places sell these for $1.99 a can. Extorsion, yes, but sometimes the toast just isn't the same without. <li>Marmite. Love it or�hate it. <li>Tea. I've found a handful of places that import Twinings and life has improved with the discovery.</li></ul><p>I've a feeling this entry will be subject to a few edits and additions.</p>
