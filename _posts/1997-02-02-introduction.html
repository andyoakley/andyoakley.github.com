<em>Taken from the Madagascar Team 1 Journal, originally by Catherine</em>

In the Christmas term of 1996 the fifth and sixth form received a visit from Camilla Blood - a representative from World Challenge. She talked to us about taking part in an expedition, the opportunities to develop in maturity, leadship skills and responsibility. The challenge of surviving in a foreign country for a month with an alien culture. The amazing signs and, of course, leeches, insects, altitude sickness, fatigue and stomach upsets.

Undeterred, over 36 people expressed an interest in taking part (encouraged by favourable reports from the Upper VI who had travelled to Equador). It was decideed that, to allow everybody who so wished to go, two teams would be formed. Team 1 was to be led by Mr George and Team 2 by Mr Gambles. We each nominated one other person whom we wanted to be in a team with and left the two teachers with the task of splitting the group.

We had an initial team meeting later that term in which we started to talk about fitness, fund-raising and an itinerary but little definite was set out. In February, World Challenge organised an evening in which parents could come and hear about the company and about previous expeditions. We were also issued with a World Challenge prospectus and a parents' brief which outlined a proposed itinerary, booking, legal and insurance arrangements. We were recommended to find out as much as possible about Madagascar and to start fund-raising as soon as possible.
