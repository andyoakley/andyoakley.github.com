As I've branched out into more photographic experimentation, it's become increasingly apparent that I needed a decent tripod to compose some of the longer exposure shots. Last weekend I picked up a <a href="http://www.giottos.com/MT-2.htm">Giottos tripod</a> but haven't really had an opportunity to try it out so after tonight's run, I took a quick stroll down to the bridge over the freeway and took some quick shots.

Lots to learn and practice here but it's going to be fun.
