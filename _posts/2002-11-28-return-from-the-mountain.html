Leaving an overcast, misty Seattle, the outlook wasn't great, but we were delighted with how the weather treated us.</p><p>Perfectly clear in <a href="http://www.nps.gov/mora/">Mount Rainier National Park</a>, we headed straight on up to Paradise, the highest location accessible by road. Then on foot, we set out in the snow on upwards, making way to Glacier Vista before turning round to make it back before dusk.</p><p>On Tuesday, after a night in the National Park Inn, we set out after a hearty breakfast of blueberry pancakes. With more time, we had lunch at Paradise Point (6800 ft), and I went on alone up to McClure's Rock (7380 ft).</p><p>Photos are <a href="/default.aspx?id=50">here</a>.</p>
