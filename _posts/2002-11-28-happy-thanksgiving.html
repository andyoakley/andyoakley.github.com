<p><div>Thanksgiving Day in America is a time to offer thanks, of family gatherings and holiday meals. A time of turkeys, stuffing, and pumpkin pie. A time for Indian corn, holiday parades and giant balloons...</div></p><p>We took a brisk walk around Alki this morning, once again great weather and fine views of the city. A fantastic lunch with Sean and Jen, a real American experience. I have spent the evening being full and finding delight on the <a href="http://www.butterball.com">Butterball</a> web site.</p><p>Tomorrow starts with <a href="http://www.thebon.com">The Bon</a> holiday parade through downtown Seattle and we'll see what happens after that.</p><p>I forgot to mention the run I did yesterday; about 5 miles up the waterfront and back. Although I'm somewhat out of practice, exercise is proving much easier these days. The <a href="http://www.seattlemarathon.org">marathon</a> awaits, but not this year.</p>
