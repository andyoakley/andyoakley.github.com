<p>In preparing for the Christmas Party at the <a href="http://www.emplive.com/">Experience Music Project</a> this evening, I've found myself needing a smart shirt so that I look somewhat presentable.</p><p>After unpacking the iron I bought months ago from the box, I set to the task. Ironing is hard! It's not exactly perfect, but it'll to have to do.</p><p>As a sidenote, tonight was a significant achievement - it's the first time I've resisted going to the store to by a new shirt when in need. The fear of ironing will no longer rule my life.</p>
