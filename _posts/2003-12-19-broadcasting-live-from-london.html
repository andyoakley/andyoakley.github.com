I've been listening to the <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/worldservice/">World Service</a> quite a bit recently, I know not why. Something today reminded of <a href="http://www.benhammersley.com/dparchives/004256.html">a post by Ben Hammersley</a> that made me smile. Where would we be without the BBC?
