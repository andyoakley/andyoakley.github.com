The burden of being captain once again weighs upon me. Why people don't read their e-mail is beyond my understanding. Certainly makes organising things more than a little difficult.<br /><br /><br />Frank's back and complaining of low quality food (cooked by himself). Rob gave me a demonstration of his 'rollers'. Quite why anyone chooses to cycle stationary when they could just as easily go for a ride is beyond me.<br />
