Amy and I both got Big S passes this year which give unlimited access to the Summit at Snoqualmie. During the winter snowstorm we actually got a couple of good days of powder up there which was a pleasant break from expectations.

Meanwhile, one of the added bonuses of the pass is five free trips to some other resorts in the area; today we went to Crystal Mountain near Mt Rainier. Although there wasn't much fresh snow, there were few people around, clear skies, no precipitation and some fun skiing.

It's cold in Seattle, in the mid-high teens this evening and we could certainly feel it on the mountain. The prepared skier uses every available opportunity and resource to stay warm in such conditions.
