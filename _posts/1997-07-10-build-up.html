<em>Taken from the Madagascar Team 1 Journal, originally by Kay</em>

And finally, the day arrived. Well almost. Being waved off into the Sports Hall didn't quite justify the tearful farewells. I don't think it's quite sunk in yet - we're going to Madagascar tomorrow.

The first event on the lists was putting up the tents. A seemingly simple task, except that we had never seen this type of tent before. However, after a few false starts, ripped fly sheets and bent tent pegs, the tents were finally up. And taken down again.

The rest of the day passed fairly uneventfully - handing out kit, discussing expectations and handing out jobs. I was hoping for a fire at the barbecue just so I'd have something to write about, but apart from few cremated sausages, everything went smoothly. We all finally got to sleep, despite Graeme's snoring, at some time after 11pm.
