<em>Taken from the Madagascar Team 1 Journal, originally by Charley</em>

As I awoke to my new responsibilities as leader I thought I was in for a stress-free day... a morning trek through the rainforest and an afternoonto fill... which would come to a thoroughly satisfying end when Nanah returned from town with our beer! Little did I know how we would 'fill' our afternoon..

As we left the campsite our guides told us that we were off into the bamboo forest in search of more lemurs. Along the way our guide developed a curious habit of stopping every so often to pick up the odd leaf or flower. I was intrigued, but fearing some rain forest fady, I didn't ask.. all was then revealed.

We stopped for a water break and the guide asked us to gather round whilst he shared some of the truly remarkable secrets of the rainforest with us. He amazingly showed us leaf after leaf, flower after flower, told us its name and then went on to describe its healing qualities. We witnessed everything... from cures for the comon cold to anti-rheumatism agents! Martin acquired some large looking green leaves complete with instructions and a description of exactly what they would do for his legs! The group seemed totally in awe of the rainforest's healing powers - we all wondered how on earth such powers were ever detected in the first place. It is remarkable to think that whilst the devleoped world still strives to perfect its medicine a developing country such as Madagascar has discovered so many effective medicine substitutes.

As we wandered further into the rainforest we witnessed more lemurs and... funnily enough... whilst in the bamboo forest we greeted several bamboo lemurs! Amidst a flourish of camera flashes I noticed that in the National Park the majority of lemurs wear collars and tags and whilst I know that this enabled the Malagasy people to conserve their wildlife it seems sad that tourism has resulting in guides being able to locate a lemur at a moments notice.

Upon our return to camp for lunch it was established that the afternoon would be spent discussing the next phase of our expedition... Isalo National Park. Martin, Nat and Suzanne pointed out that whilst in Isalo the whole team should, and indeed wanted to be, physically challenged. However, what is a physical challenge to one is a leisurely afternoon stroll to another! And so I was to discuss the options with the team and we were to establish a rough itinerary.

A healthy debate followed... much was discussed... and being the focal point of a heated debat was not exactly fun! Should we split the team? Should half have a rest day? Which route should we follow? Is that distance possible in one day? But Charley, you din't tell us that the group with only 1 'adult' would have to remain at camp due to safety... arghhh! It has to be said that not a great deal was decided on - we would split the group for one day - when and where would be discussed with the guides in Isalo - but the team was now aware of the options open.

The afternoon was spent on what has to be called a rather unsuccessful swimming and fishing expedition... Hanah, Pokey and Martin were impressed with the HUGE termite that they found and prompty chopped in half to us for rather pointless fish bait!

The evening passed around yet another stunning campfire... and dried rations taste so much better under a beautiful starry sky and with a bottle of Three Horses Beer in your hand!!
