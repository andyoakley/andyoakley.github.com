<p><i>Taken from Lauren's diary of our trip to South East Asia</i></p><p>Got up and had breakfast in the hotel (with small ghost-like poached eggs). We got a taxi to near Wat Pho and then walked to the river and hired a long-tail boat and a driver. He took us on a tour of the Khlongs (canals) including a stop for feeding some strange fish. Afterwards, we got a taxi. Our driver told us if we looked around a shop he brought us to, he would get petrol vouchers and we wouldn't have to pay him for the taxi ride (we were suspicious, but had little choice all the same). Andy bought a tie. Sure enough we got our taxi ride free and arrived at the World Trade Centre (a big shopping centre). We walked around, had some lunch and e-mailed home. Then we taxied back to our hotel. This evening we walked in the street market near our hotel and had dinner in a Deli France (french bakery). Andy got a fake Breitling watch and a fake Oakley T-shirt. Lauren got a ring a hairclip, a sarong and a fake polo T-shirt for under a tenner. Back to the hotel and watched some TV.</p>
