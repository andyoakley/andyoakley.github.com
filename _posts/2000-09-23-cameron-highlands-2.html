<p><i>Taken from Lauren's diary of our trip to South East Asia</i></p><p>Got up at 6am, had breakfast, checked out and taxied to the bus station. We had a six hour bus trip to the Cameron Highlands (a rather hairy journey in parts). We walked to the Cool Point Hotel which isn't very nice, but will do. We went out and bought some junk food and our bus tickets to KL for Monday. Hotel. Ate our food. Steve Redgrave won his fifth gold medal as part of the British coxless IV in the Olympics. We watched the 100m sprint finals on TV - Marion Jones and Maurice Greene won. We went to an internet place and set e-mail home. Then we went to the Orient restaurant and had a steamboat (like a fondue Chinese). Afterwards we bought some vodka and drank some on our balcony.</p>
