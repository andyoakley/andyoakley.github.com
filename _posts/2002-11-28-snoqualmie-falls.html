<p>Watched (most of) the Thanksgiving Parade through downtown Seattle this morning. Thanksgiving truly does represent the start of the holiday season, and the decorations and festivities were present in force. I remain amazed by the fact that each American high school has a marching band, and they're all really good.</p><p>We headed out to <a href="http://www.snoqualmiefalls.com/">Snoqualmie Falls</a> to take in the view and then on up into the pass to the <a href="http://www.summit-at-snoqualmie.com">Summit</a>.
