<p>It's been said so many times before, but I'm certain TV really does rot the brain. </p><p>Although I fully appreciate the entertainment value, it really does stifle the imagination. I can semi-happily spend a couple of hours watching TV. The time passes quickly enough, but one can hardly describe the experience as productive or even worthwhile.</p><p>I find myself spending a great deal of time sitting and thinking these days. I revel in the minutes waiting at bus stops - amidst the noise and the haste (traffic in this case) there's something very tranquil about the world of thought.</p><p>With this said, I'm still pleased that the only time I seem to get bored is when I'm actually watching TV. </p>
