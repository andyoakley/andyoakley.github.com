King County is running a series of posters on the metro at the moment aiming to raise awareness of HIV. <div align="center"><a href="http://www.metrokc.gov/health/apu/"><img src="http://www.metrokc.gov/health/apu/advertisement/busbannerX.png" border="0"></a></div>Leading with the question &quot;Who is affected by HIV?&quot;, the ad features a 'cross-section' consisting of eight people, all African-American.Seems like someone forgot to check for the subliminal message in that one.
