I'm coming to the party a little late on this one but was interested by this story.

<a href="http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052748704615504576172701898769040.html?mod=wsj_share_facebook">A Union Education - WSJ.com</a>:
<blockquote>The trend is even starker if you go back a decade earlier. In 1960, 31.9% of the private work force belonged to a union, compared to only 10.8% of government workers. By 2010, the numbers had more than reversed, with 36.2% of public workers in unions but only 6.9% in the private economy.

...

unlike in the private economy, a public union has a natural monopoly over government services. An industrial union will fight for a greater share of corporate profits, but it also knows that a business must make profits or it will move or shut down.</blockquote>
No such check exists in this scenario. The consequences are even more extreme when the normal realities of the marketplace are removed from the equation.
