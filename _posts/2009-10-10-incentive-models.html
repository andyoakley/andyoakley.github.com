Over the last few years I've been gathering examples of interesting cases in an area that I've generally called 'incentive models'. This post serves as an introduction to a series of observations, some where the right model works well and others where the shortcomings are.

First let's define an incentive model as the set of circumstances that make certain behaviors or outcomes inevitable. In other words, how does the environment relate to the choices individuals make in going about their lives. In what way do constraints on time, a philosophy of issuing rewards, a practice of acknowledgment of achievement, a feeling of ownership or a sense of belonging have on an individual's or a group's choices, priorities, level of enthusiasm and trade-offs?
