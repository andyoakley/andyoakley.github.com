It's a telling sign when you know the 194 bus timetable (Seattle-Seatac airport) without having to look it up. I'm about to catch a ride to the airport for the fourth time in the last seven weeks.Looking forward to spending some quiet vacation time back at home over Thanksgiving. The longer I live away, the clearer my notion of homeland is becoming.
