Again a bit of a poor show on the blog front. I've just spent a while getting <a href="http://webcam.formalhall.com/">webcam.formalhall.com</a> to archive every five minutes. Probably something to look back at.<br /><p>The weekend came and went. Good fun curry at the <b>Bengal</b> on Saturday and a veritable night of alcohol consumption followed. Woke up on Sunday morning with an awful hangover and food poisoning. Sick all day long.<br /><p>Circuits yesterday followed by my first run of the term has left my body aching. But I'm feeling pretty fit all the same. Going out for dinner with Lauren tonight to celebrate our two-year anniversary (yesterday).
