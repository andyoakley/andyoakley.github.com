<p><i>Taken from Lauren's diary of our trip to South East Asia</i></p><p>We got up, missing the hotel breakfast by setting Andy's alarm clock to ring at the right time at home. We got a taxi to the Royal Grand Palace. We went around in and to the Wat Phra Kaeo (Temple of the Emerald Buddha). They were very ornated and beautiful. We had some water and a coconut each at a little place there (you get a green coconut with the top cut off, drink the milk with a straw and eat the flesh with a spoon). Then we got a tuk-tuk to Wat Pho, more ornate stuff (lovely) and a huge (46m long) reclining Buddha (the largest in Thailand). After that we walked down a dodgy little street and got a long-tail boat for a hairy ride across the river to Wat Arun (Temple of the Dawn). It was nice. We walked to a main road and got a taxi back to our hotel. We went for a walk down Sukhumvit Road (near our hotel) and went to McDonalds for tea. We walked through some street market back to the hotel.</p>
