Well, I've just about finished all of my immediate tasks, and the whole boat organisation problem has solved itself quite neatly. Had another e-mail from Microsoft with a Needs assessment form attached to be filled in. Exciting times.<br /><br /><br />All that remains is to complete a personal statement for my progress review with the Vice-Master, 'setting out [my] aspirations/goals and the extent to which they will have [been] fulfilled while at Jesus College'. Time for a bit of thought perhaps. <br />
