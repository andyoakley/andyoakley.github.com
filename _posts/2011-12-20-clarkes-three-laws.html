<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clarke's_three_laws">Clarke's laws</a>:
<ol>
	<li>When a distinguished but elderly scientist states that something is possible, he is almost certainly right. When he states that something is impossible, he is very probably wrong.</li>
	<li>The only way of discovering the limits of the possible is to venture a little way past them into the impossible.</li>
	<li><strong>Any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic.</strong></li>
</ol>
