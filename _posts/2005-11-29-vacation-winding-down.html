<p>Just grabbed some lunch with Sean and Ethan at the <a href="http://www.merchantduvin.com/pages/3_pike_brewing/pub_welcome.html">Pike Place Pub</a>, homeï¿½to a particularly good rendition of chicken nachos. Back to work tomorrow assuming the slim to nothing chance of a snow day doesn't become real.</p><p>At some point I have to muster the courage to read all of the mail that's been building up. Not looking forward to that one bit.</p>
