<p>Heard on NPR this morning, a poem by John Greenleaf Whittier.</p><p><strong>The Poor Voter on Election Day</strong></p><p>To-day, of all the weary year,<br />A king of men am I.<br />To-day, alike are great and small,<br />The nameless and the known;<br />My palace is the people's hall,<br />The ballot-box my throne!<br />The rich is level with the poor,<br />The weak is strong to-day;<br />And sleekest broadcloth counts no more<br />Than homespun frock of gray.<br />To-day let pomp and vain pretence<br />My stubborn right abide;<br />I set a plain man's common sense<br />Against the pedant's pride.<br />The wide world has not wealth to buy<br />The power in my right hand!</p>
