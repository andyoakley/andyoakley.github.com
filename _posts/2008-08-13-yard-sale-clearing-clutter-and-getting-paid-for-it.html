<p>Check off one more experience from the list: a multi-family yard sale.</p> <p>It's fascinating to see the pros in action. We said it started at 9am, the early birds were poking around shortly after 8am. You put a rock bottom price on something, bargaining starts at half of that. One gentleman mysteriously put forth a closed fist containing his offer for a $2 cake pan, slowly opened it to reveal a single nickel. And the biggest bartering is always for the last quarter. </p> <p>Despite the overnight rain, it stayed dry and we had a constant stream of people until about 2pm. When all was done, the haul was over $300 and the remainder needed just one full truck trip to the Goodwill store.</p> <p>Profit!</p> <p><a title="U-District summer multi-family yard sale" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/33404495@N00/2759479865/"><img alt="U-District summer multi-family yard sale" src="http://static.flickr.com/3027/2759479865_426c3897ec.jpg" border="0"></a></p>
