<p>The <a href="http://www.xbox.com/en-US/hardware/xbox360/default.htm">Xbox 360</a> started 'selling' in stores nationwide today. I took a stroll down to EB this morning to see about picking one up but came back empty handed. I knew the pre-orders were going to get the lion's share but suspected they might have a couple of spares for walk-ins. Indeed they did, but when the retailers force the sale of a $399 console into a $700+tax bundle, I just can't do it. </p><p>As a side note, I've found the cause of the splitting headache I've been harboring for the last couple of days. An�hour�after a triple-venti-mocha infusion courtesy of Starbucks after a three day abstinence vanquished any remaining doubt that my taste for coffee is purely casual.</p>
