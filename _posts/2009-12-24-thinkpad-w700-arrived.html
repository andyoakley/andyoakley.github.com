Just in time for Christmas (well, not really) my <a href="http://shop.lenovo.com/us/notebooks/thinkpad/w-series/w700">ThinkPad W700</a> arrived this morning. First impression: this thing is a monster. While it's big, it's not as heavy as I was expecting, but was really snappy right out of the box and has a fabulous, vivid screen. The built-in tablet, calibrator and webcam all seem nice too. I'm now loading up Photoshop, Lightroom, Office and VS ready for our trip which is just a few weeks away now.

Aside: this little box has come a long way to get here.
