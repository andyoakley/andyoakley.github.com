I've finally completed one of my challenges for the year, War and Peace. It would be fair to say I enjoyed it - not exactly an easy read, but quite an interesting one, especially to someone only vaguely familiar with the subject matter. The intricate, almost painful, level of detail soon becomes expected, and turns out to be quite a powerful way of describing large-scale events; by conveying every aspect of just a subset of those present, a rather vivid picture of the whole is created.I had been saving a $5 bill in the back as some reward for this moment, but sadly a gust of wind carried it away somewhere while sailing in Australia. Although they say 90% of US currency is out of America at any time, I doubt there's too much nestling in the coral of the Great Barrier Reef.
