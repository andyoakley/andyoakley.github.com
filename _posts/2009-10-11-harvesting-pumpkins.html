It's fall and that can only mean that Halloween is just around the corner. With good weather this morning, a quick search for 'pumpkins' on Yelp and we were headed to <a href="http://www.thefarm1.com/">The Farm at Swan's Trail</a> in Snohomish. They have it all - a corn maze, a hay maze, wagon rides, cow trains and a substantial pumpkin patch.

Although there were a lot families there the place is huge and there is plenty to go around.

With pumpkins chosen we enjoyed a polish dog, corn and apple cider for lunch. Great way to spend a crisp, sunny morning.
