<p>On November 5, 2001 I boarded a plane and set off for a great adventure in an unknown land. Three years on, I'm still here, the adventure continues and the land doesn't seem quite as foreign any more.</p><p>There was a time that I felt comfortable comparing 'here and there' but it's becoming more and more difficult. I've not been back to the UK since last Thanksgiving (that sentence itself it rather telling) and while the BBC does a fantastic job of keeping people in touch presence counts for a lot. Still, some material things are hard to forget - good chocolate, bacon, baked beans, Ribena, Polos, Marmite, brown sauce, Hobnobs and Twiglets to name a few.</p>
