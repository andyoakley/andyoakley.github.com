The <a href="http://www.fraserislandco.com.au/">trip</a> to Fraser Island was good, couldn't have asked for better conditions than we're getting at the moment. Our highly informed driver, Glen, gave ongoing commentary while hauling the massive 4WD bus through the sand. Standing on the so called 75-mile beach (which also doubles as a 100kph highway), the horizon seems to stretch out forever towards the east, no rocks, no land, no ships, just water and sky. The night bus awaits.
