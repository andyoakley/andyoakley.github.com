<em>Taken from the Madagascar Team 1 Journal, originally by Kay</em>

We set off for work and arrived at the first site at 8 am. After sitting around for an hour, waiting for the people from Feedback Madagascar to arrive with the tools, we decided to find out what was going on. Three people set off for the other site, thn returned having met some people on the way. We eventually started work and did a few more plant boxes, then went back home for lunch.

After lunch and a bit of a relax, we went for a wander around the nature reserve. It was rather uneventful, but it was nice to feel that you were in a bit of a rain forest.

The evening was designated as games night, but the number of people actually well enough to play was so few, that it had to be reduced to just 3 games (the malingerers were taking up 2 rooms - how selfish can you get?)

The night ended with a game of consequences which showed up the more inventive - and one-track minded - people in the group, and was a good laugh.
