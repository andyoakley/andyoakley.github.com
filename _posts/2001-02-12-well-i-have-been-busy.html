Well I have been busy. The river has been flooding again, and the red flag means that there's no rowing at the moment. Got a couple of sneaking outings out at the weekend, which was good. Looking forward to the <b>Robinson Head</b> and <b>Pembroke Regatta</b> this weekend. Finally got the <a href="http://www.horr.co.uk">Mens Head</a> entry off today, which is good. Chris Rodrigues is getting back to me soon as well...<br /><p><b>St Rhadegunds</b> day on Sunday was fun, with a formal hall with the <b>misfits</b>. Carnage as expected.<br /><p>My presentation went fine, and I'm looking to start my dissertation pretty soon now. Loads of supervisions in the past couple of days leave me with a fairly free timetable for the time being, which is good.
