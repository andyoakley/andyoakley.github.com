<p>On this day in 1605, Guy Fawkes was <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guy_Fawkes">arrested in a cellar</a>. The�British mark this frightfully fortunate event (which would�otherwise have reduced parliament to rubble) by making huge bonfires and�lighting fireworks. The making and burning of effigies doubtlessly scars many a young child but that's how it's done - good clean family fun. Meanwhile, the chaps legacy lives on as one of the most common words in English (even American) today - guy.</p>
