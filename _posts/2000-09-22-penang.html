<p><i>Taken from Lauren's diary of our trip to South East Asia</i></p><p>Got up and had breakfast in the hotel. Booked bus tickets to the Cameron Highlands. We went out and walked to the seafront and Fort Cornwallis. We walked around it and then got a taxi to the Penang Hill Fernicular Railway which we took to the top. There were very good views of Georgetown and the Melaka Straits. We bought some bombay mix and some Coke that tasted like medicine. We came down again and got a bus back to the Komtar centre (after some confusion). We went to McDonalds for a snack, walked around, and then back to our hotel. Lay down for a while. TV. For dinner we went to Pizza Hut in the Komtar centre. We bought an electronic mosquito repeller in a supermarket. Back to the hotel. We went in the steam room and jacuzzi in the hotel (meeting some naked Japanese business men) and then to bed.</p>
