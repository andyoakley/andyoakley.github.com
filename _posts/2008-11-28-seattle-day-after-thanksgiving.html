The weather was wet, cold and windy this morning for the Macy's parade in downtown Seattle. There have been better years but the crowds still showed up and the bands marched with enthusiasm. With the buses running late this morning I didn't really get a chance to get a good spot for an angle on the parade itself so went for some crowd candids instead.
