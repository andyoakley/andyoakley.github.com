From an NPR article on <a href="http://www.npr.org/2011/03/27/134866003/gamifying-the-system-to-create-better-behavior">'Gamifying' The System To Create Better Behavior</a>:
<blockquote>Now, imagine that same camera also snaps a photo of your car when you are driving at or under the speed limit. For your safe driving, you are entered into a lottery to win a portion of the money from fines paid by speeders.

That idea was tested in Sweden with great success. It's an example of "gamification," considered the next wave of social engagement and Internet technology.

Instead of being structured around punishment and negativity, he says, the speed-camera lottery is "all about positive reinforcement." If you drive the speed limit, or under it, you may win some money.  "And that positive incentive to create better behavior," he says, "is a core tenet of games."</blockquote>
I think there's a huge opportunity here both for startups wanting to capitalize but also for the consequential cultural changes it can bring. I foresee a significant rise in the prevalence of strategies like this for getting people do the right thing by default.

At the same time it reminds me of another NPR story <a href="http://www.npr.org/blogs/money/2011/02/28/134033237/what-a-coin-toss-has-to-do-with-the-housing-market">What A Coin Toss Has To Do With The Housing Market</a> which talks about how humans are wired to be loss averse rather than calculating, probability engines:
<blockquote>He offered me a sweet bet on the flip of a coin. If the coin came up heads, I would win $6. If it came up tails, I would lose $1.

I told him I'd take the bet.

But then he changed the terms — if the coin came up heads, I would win $6. If it came up tails, I would lose $4. That bet I didn't like.

Of course, this is irrational. The bet is still very much in my favor. If I took the bet 1,000 times, I'd almost certainly make a nice profit.

...

As it turns out, our brains feel losses and gains unevenly: Losing feels worse than winning feels good.</blockquote>
So the real trick is how to leverage this these human traits rather than to work against them.
