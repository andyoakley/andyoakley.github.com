After an uneasy night's sleep, when wild dogs roamed around the campsite we awoke to breakfast of soup and bread. The guides then led us into the Canyon des Singes where we came close up to the first ring-tailed lemurs that we had seen on the expedition. The canyon was a lush green paradise in the midst of the hot, baron landscape of Isalo. We sepnt the morning trekking deep into the canyon, clambering over rocks which, had we had our big rucksacks on - would have been near impossible. A group photo was taken by the guides, of us all on a huge rock. Unfortuantely, some photos were ruined by an extremely rude foreign man walking straight in front of us.

We returned to the campsite for lunch which conssted of Tuc biscuits (Which we soon became very sick of), sardines, tuna and good old Laughing Cow cheese. The guides did not want to set off again too early so Martin took the opportunity to remove min and Graeme's jiggers. There was no pain (it's all in the mind) while Martin was digging around with a pin in my little toe, but he successfully removed my jigger to leave a slight crater in my toe which I have to admit did sting slightly when iodine was put into it.

In the afternoon, we set off on a shorter trek in the Canyon du Rats. At one point an adventurous group set off to clamber over the rocks, to explore the nearby area. About a quarter of an hour later they returned with Graeme looking like a drowned rat because he'd falled into a sacred pool thus he was now blessed with eternal life. We then returned to the campsite, sighting several tobs on the way.

Dinner consisted of dried food and pasta. I must say that I feel sory for Suzanne and Catherine because both the vegetable chilli and curry (which are exactly the same) are exceptionally grim. At least the meat ones are edible. We all got an early night's sleep as we had to get up at 4.30 am the next morning. I had the job, as leader, of getting everyone up and ready to leave by six. Everyone was ready by this time except Suzanne and Martin who must be the two most disorganised people on our expedition!
