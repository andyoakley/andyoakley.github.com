In the same way Google is <a href="http://news.google.com">rethinking the way we read news</a>, I see RSS aggregation introducing the human element into how one determines what news is important. Along similar lines, I came across the <a href="http://tangle.sourceforge.net/">tangle</a> project, which seeks to create links between pages based on how users move between them. It reminds me of Feynmann and his experiments with ants, but the cynic in me suggests this is wide open to potential abuse.</p><p>I took an aimless walk around the city this evening. There's a different feeling in the air, everyone knows the holidays are coming. I came very close to ordering an eggnog latte in <a href="http://www.starbucks.com">Starbucks</a>, but that seems a little premature.</p><p>My fantasy team is getting well and truly beaten this week :(. Still, I've bought tickets to see the <a href="http://www.seahawks.com">Seahawks</a> play the <a href="http://www.kcchiefs.com">Chiefs</a> when my parents are visiting, so that should be fun.</p>
