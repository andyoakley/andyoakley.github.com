<p>With�a�crisp morning and a subtle fog that lingered until just before noon, today is a holiday. Over the last few years, the idea of Thanksgiving has quickly made its way to near the top of my favorite holiday list. I'm not sure whether birthdays count, but I'm not a huge fan of massive celebration about my own. Christmas has�a lot going for it with its spirit and general sense of warmth on cold days and New Year is always a good opportunity to look both ways.</p><p>But Thanksgiving is about taking stock and being thankful for all that we have. My list is my own�but as I give it some thought, it turns out to be rather long.</p><p>Oh, and there's turkey too. Lots of turkey. Today, tomorrow and for the rest of the week. Jenna has kindly invited me and Katie for dinner today which I'm certainly looking forward to and tomorrow we set off before dawn for <a href="http://andyoakley.com/blog/archive/2004/11/28/526.aspx">Stehekin</a>.</p>
