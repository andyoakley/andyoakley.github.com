It recently dawned on me that I can't actually remember the last time I heard silence - absolutely nothing, pure calm. By day, I enjoy air conditioning and the whirring of five computer fans and by night, the noise of traffic that never stops. Pins could be dropping everywhere and I simply wouldn't notice. I have some memory, without place or time, of being in a farmhouse at night. It was so dark I couldn't tell whether my eyes were open and every movement came with a jarring sound. I wonder whether there's a market to sell the experience like the oxygen bars in Tokyo.
