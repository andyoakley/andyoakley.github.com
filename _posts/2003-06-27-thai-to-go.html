It's taken me far too long to discover Thai Rama II on Spring &amp; Post Alley. I had a great green chicken curry (with bits of pineapple) which came very close to rivalling the fare of <a href="http://www.wrestlers.co.uk/">The Wrestlers</a>.As an aside, I also came across the great <a href="http://570bars.com">570bars.com</a> site. A five hundred and seventy venue bar crawl requires some serious stamina and dedication. Well done to those chaps.
