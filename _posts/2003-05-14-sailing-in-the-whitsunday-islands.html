We made landfall at 13.30 this afternoon, after a three day <a href="http://www.soxsail.com.au">trip</a> on the 80ft world-class racing yacht, <a href="http://www.soxsail.com.au/fleet_siska.php">Siska</a>.The privilege of spotting Elvis, the resident <a href="http://www.reeftrip.com/Marinepic3.htm">Maori Wrasse</a> at Blue Pearl Bay set things off in the right spirit. Then on Whitehaven Beach, one of the <a href="http://www.expedia.co.uk/daily/promos/bestbeach/u_whitehaven.asp">greatest beaches</a> in the world. With great conditions for sailing and only a bit rain (just last night, but it was real rain), we moved on to Stonehaven Bay this morning to snorkel with the sting rays and coral.The crew was great, the food awesome and the vessel impressive. I have the utmost respect for the crews that race those yachts for a living; harsh conditions, damp cabins and tough competition, but I can certainly see the thrill.Pictures:(moved to <a href="http://www.andyoakley.com/gallery/australia/">the gallery</a>)
