<p>At the peak of the hierarchy of spiritual beings stand those elemental forces of nature which have no concrete form. At their head is Kaila, the god of weather and of the sky. Kaila is the creator and thus the paramount godhead of the people. He is aloof, as the mightiest deity should be and man is no more than dust under his feet. He demands neither abasement nor worship from those he created. But Kaila is a just god, for he is all things brought about by the powers of nature, and nature, who is completely impartial, cannot be unjust.</p><p>It is permissible to appeal to Kaila, yet there is no implicit belief that Kaila will hear or respond to prayers couched in the midge-like voices of men. This quality of impersonality, of detachment, in this god of the Ihalmuit strengthens the majesty of his power. Kaila is no simple creation of mens' imaginings shackled to the whims and fancies of human minds. Kaila, to the people, is an essence. Kaila is not spoken of with fear, nor yet with love. Kaila is. That is enough. What man may do or not do is of no more direction concern to Kaila than the comings and goings of ants under the moss. Kaila is not a moral force, because the Ihalmuit have no need of a spiritual magistrate to administer moral law. Kaila is essential power. He is the wind over the plains; he is the sky and the flickering lights of the sky. Kaila is the power of running water and in the motion of falling snow. </p><p>He is nothing - he is all things.</p>
