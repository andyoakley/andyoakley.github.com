Among many other things, Amazon.com sells jewelry. Given the amount of business I've sent their way over the years, it seemed fitting that we'd get my wedding band from Amazon also.

For this particular purchase I was Â delighted by the recommendations for other products I might be interested in. For a mens gold wedding band, size 9, the top suggested item is none other than the venerable Linksys WRT54G router.

I am in good company.
