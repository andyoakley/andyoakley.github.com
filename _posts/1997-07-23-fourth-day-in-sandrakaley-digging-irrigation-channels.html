Thrown straight in as leader due to Dave's untimely illness, I gave everyone the chance of a lie-in. Then we wandered to our new project site, digging irrigation channels. Only just over half of us were well enough to go 'to work', not that it really mattered, as there were only two spades. So, the rota system of work meant that we all did a whole ten minutes digging each. Well, most of us, that is, as some people sat around and watched.

After lunch, we went back to the nature reserve, and in groups counted trees of various sizes. A local Madagascan told us the names of the trees in our area and we got some heart laughs whilst trying to repeat them. Back at the school houe we had to prepare a report to deliver to the other groups on how many of the different types of tree threre were of specific sizes in our area. Not for any particular reason, just because it would be nice for us to know, I think.

Dinner was good - a dessert of pineapple flambe and chocolate sauce rounded it off nicely - and was fllowed by grouping, with some of the locals, around the campfire. Songs were sung and dances were danced, and this proved to be a warm-up for Friday's "goodbye to the locals".

Team One's rendition of "The Patio Song", left a lot to be desired, however the Great British Passport Holders were somewhat saved by Sally's solo of one of her Italian songs. This earned her the nickname of Pavarotti; and quite rightly too. The evening passed with Charley earning herself the name "Chunder", not without good reason too, I might add, and everyone being eaten alive by all of the bugs.
