<blockquote><span style="color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, serif; line-height: 20px;">One thing which occurs to me is that many people have a tendency to think of statistics in an isolated way. This world view keeps statistics at bay, as something which is done separately from other business activities, and, importantly, which is done andÂ <strong>understood </strong>only by the statisticians. This is very far from the ideal which I suggest, in which statistics (including data mining) are much more integrated with the business processes of which they are a part.</span></blockquote>
