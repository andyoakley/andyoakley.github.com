There are a few apps and websites I'm really enjoying at the moment.
<ul>
	<li><a href="http://www.skype.com">Skype</a>. Video chat is high quality and 'just works' even to far corners of the world. Brings remote friends and family closer together.</li>
	<li><a href="http://www.foursquare.com">Foursquare</a>. Strangely addictive about-town game where you 'check in' to report where you are.</li>
	<li><a href="http://www.tinychat.com">Tinychat</a>. This is how video conferencing and collaboration should be. Not hugely sophisticated but easy to set up and works.</li>
	<li><a href="http://www.yelp.com">Yelp</a>. The critical mass is there and the bulk of reviews are good quality. Angie's List was handy for a year but is going to have a hard time competing over the long run.</li>
	<li><a href="http://www.rescuetime.com">RescueTime</a>. Still in my two-week trial but I love the idea of <a href="http://andyoakley.com/2009/06/05/by-the-numbers/">passively collecting information about activity</a>. This particular tool consists of an installed app that tracks where you're spending screen time (along with offline activities like meetings and phone calls) and a web-based reporting dashboard.</li>
	<li><a href="http://www.mint.com">Mint</a>. Once you swallow the whole 'trust your bank credentials to someone else thing', this website and iPhone app make tracking money really easy.</li>
	<li><a href="http://www.tweetree.com">Tweetree</a>, <a href="http://motionobj.com/simplytweet">SimplyTweet</a>, <a href="http://www.tweetdeck.com">TweetDeck</a>. Twitter clients of choice depending on form factor.</li>
</ul>
Still on the look out for a good massive-dataset visualization toolkit.
