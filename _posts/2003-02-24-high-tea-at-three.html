Maybe we start looking for things when suspicion is aroused, it's hard to tell.</p><p>Waiting for the bus this morning, bagel in one hand, Starbucks venti mocha in the other, I dropped a quarter in newspaper dispenser on the corner and picked up a copy of the <a href="http://www.seattlepi.com">PI</a> (this may have required a third hand, artistic license I believe it's called). I had a fleeting thought of how comfortable and natural it all felt, and that surprised me a little. But I was wearing socks with a Union Jack on them, so it was all OK.</p><p>Arriving in to work, I did my usual five minute scan through the front pages: BBC News, The Times and The Sun. Despite what is now becoming an addiction to CNN, I think I watch it more for the pictures, still preferring the British media for content. </p><p>Later in the day, someone pointed me to the diary of <a href="http://slate.msn.com/id/2078597/entry/2078638/">Moira Redmond</a>, an ex-ex-pat. Most of her thoughts are spot on and made for an entertaining read. Incidentally, I also noticed <a href="http://www.alig.com">Ali G</a> is <a href="http://slate.msn.com/id/2079081/">headed stateside</a>. I'm fairly sure the society isn't equipped to handle this just yet, which is such a shame.</p><p>All said and done, it makes me happy to see <a href="http://idolonfox.com/judges/index.htm">Simon Cowell</a> keeping the side up. High tea at three anyone?</p>
