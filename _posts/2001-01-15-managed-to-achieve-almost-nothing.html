Managed to achieve almost nothing last night. Slept on Lauren's futon which was so comfortable I enjoyed it until about 11am this morning. Just sorted through a barrage of e-mails, seems like I'm missing my <a href="http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~jmb/">DoS</a> meeting today. Never mind, they never seem to mean much anyway. The usual rowing banter is there as well.<br /><p>I was pleased last night to revive my <a href="http://www.samsungyepp.com">Yepp</a> MP3 player which has been sitting unused for a few months. A little bit of scripting on <a href="http://uroborus.splo.sh">uroborus</a> allows me to resample my tunes at a mono 64Kb/s rate so that you get over an hour of decent quality music. Why I never thought of that before I don't know.
