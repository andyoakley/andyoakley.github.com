<p>Kate put it so well:</p> <blockquote> <p>It's SeaFair again, when Seattle turns into a loud, warmongering, beer drinking, low-brow pit of red-neckery.....and you love it, because it is just one day a year. <br />Please join me at the marina for the air show, hydroplanes, hot dogs and cruising in the boat with skipper Bill.&nbsp; In order to balance the general redneck aesthetic, our guests at the marina are encouraged to dress in theme; either 1960s prep-nautical-fabulous, or duran duran rio dancer video, do whatcha like. We are going to drink pimm's cups, wear blazers and cruise the lake in style.</p></blockquote> <p>And so it was. Dressed to the nines we planned to show these sea-faring folk quite how it should be done. Some bystanders watched with bewilderment, especially in the pre-outing trip to Fred Meyer, but most were clearly jealous of the style and class that had serendipitously touched their lives on this otherwise uninteresting day in August.  <p>My favorite (overheard) comment of the day: "I think they might be British". <p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/apoakley/sets/72157606530401072/">Complete Seafair set on Flickr</a> <p><a title="Oakley_20080803_0386" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/33404495@N00/2730488861/"><img alt="Oakley_20080803_0386" src="http://static.flickr.com/3156/2730488861_8f7eff3b65.jpg" border="0"></a> <p><a title="Oakley_20080803_0314" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/33404495@N00/2730486207/"><img alt="Oakley_20080803_0314" src="http://static.flickr.com/3097/2730486207_9ddd2dc05d.jpg" border="0"></a> <p><a title="Seafair 2008" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/33404495@N00/2731316452/"><img alt="Seafair 2008" src="http://static.flickr.com/3224/2731316452_98583ea27c.jpg" border="0"></a></p>
