The value of doing nothing is always underrated. A week spent doing absolutely nothing productive is great. This kind of break should be mandatory, you can't help but start to relax when there are no cell phones, e-mails or IMs in sight. Time spent reading a good novel can never be thought of as wasted (Catch 22, recommended). Time spent watching a poor part three (The Matrix Revolutions, not recommended) this afternoon with Ed could arguably be considered wasted, but I'm not going to go that far.Meanwhile, my parents' surprise purchase of a DVD recorder has given a timely opportunity to bring the <b>Ed and Werthers</b> collection into the twenty first century. Those recordings are going to be very interesting one day.
