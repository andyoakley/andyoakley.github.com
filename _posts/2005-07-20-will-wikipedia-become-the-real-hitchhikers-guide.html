<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org">Wikipedia</a> continues to amaze me with its pace of updates and breadth of content. In the news today, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_G._Roberts_Jr.">John G Roberts Jr</a> is the nominee for the open position on the Supreme Court and Wikipedia has a wealth of up to date knowledge. Impartiality not guaranteed, however, especially where politics is concerned.
