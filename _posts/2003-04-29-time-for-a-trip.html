I had the pleasure of making my first sale of shares yesterday, a process which through it's simplicity is plainly confusing. It all seems a bit artifical doing it over the web, I'd far rather bark 'sell, sell, sell' over the phone to someone; maybe you to pay for that service, I'm not sure.All this in preparation for a little jaunt to the southern hemisphere - I'm leaving Seattle Friday to arrive in Sydney, Australia on Sunday morning to meet up with Lauren on her worldwide trip. We'll make our way up to Cairns over just two weeks, a marathon perhaps, but a fun journey I'm sure.
