<p>&quot;We're going to leave this live broadcast from Geoff Hoon, British Defense Secretary, and focus on the <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2003/WORLD/meast/03/22/sprj.irq.heli.crash/index.html">crash of two British Sea King helicopters</a> because there was an American on board&quot;</p><p>It's certainly interesting to see how news is priortized during this campaign.</p><p>Meanwhile, depending how much you believe the propaganda, it looks as though things are going well. I've seen the Iraqi's dancing in the streets as promised, only it's just three people, and the cable channels are running the same tape over and over again.</p><p>Live feeds from say Al Jazeera and Iraqi state TV the would certainly help to create a more balanced believable set of reports of what is going on.</p>
