<p><i>Taken from Lauren's diary of our trip to South East Asia</i></p><p>We got up at 5.15am. Checked out, and the hotel bus left us at the train station. We got on the Bangkok-Butterworth Express (it didn't actually go very fast). We passed through Customs &amp; Imigration and the Malaysian border and arrived at Butterworth. The Eastern &amp; Oriental Express was there. We got a ferry to Penang and a taxi to our hotel, the Cititel. It's nice. We have a good view over the Melaka Straits from our 11th floor room. We walked to the Komtar centre where we ate at McDonalds and sent some e-mails. It was very hot in Penang today. Back to the hotel, showered and washed some clothes. We had some dinner in the restaurant in the hotel (next to the exclusive &quot;Foo Ling Men&quot; restaurant).</p>
