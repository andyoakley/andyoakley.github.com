After mentioning the Five Fingers <a href="http://blog.andyoakley.com/2009/06/06/vibram-five-fingers-review/">yesterday</a>, Thomas pointed out a fascinating article in the New York Magazine titled "<a href="http://nymag.com/health/features/46213/">You Walk Wrong: How we're wrecking our feet with every step we take</a>".

Given my earlier concern around joints, this was particularly reassuring:
<blockquote>They had people walk in their walking shoes, then barefoot, and each time measured the stress on their knees. They found, to their surprise, that the impact on the knees was 12 percent <em>less</em> when people walked barefoot than it was when people wore the padded shoes.</blockquote>
As for the feet, they are a tiny bit bruised on the sole but gave no problems while running around the lake today. I am becoming a fan of the barefooting.
