<p><i>Taken from Lauren's diary of our trip to South East Asia</i></p><p>We walked a bit to a Star train station and got a metro train to Merdeka Square. We went into the Masjid Jamek Mosque where Lauren had to wear a robe and headscarf. We walked around Merdeka Square and saw the Royal Selangor Club and the Sultan Abdul Samad building. We then trained to the Petronas Towers (the tallest building in the world) and walked around the Suria KLCC shopping centre (nice). We taxied to the KL Tower and went up it - there were good views. We walked back to our hotel. We booked train tickets to Singapore for Thursday in a booth at a shopping centre. Hotel. Went to Pizza Hut for dinner. Sent an e-mail home. Came back and watched &quot;The Astronaut's Wife&quot; on TV.</p>
