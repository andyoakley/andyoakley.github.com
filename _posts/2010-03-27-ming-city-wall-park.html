We set off today to explore some of the network of underground tunnels in Beijing. Built in the 1960s to accommodate 40% of the city in the event of nuclear war, they are rumored to expansive, elaborate, and home to shops, hotels, dorms and theaters. Unfortunately the tour book's 'entrance' in Chongwen (on Xidamochang Dajie) was marked as closed. We headed to another reported one on the web (at 44 Xingfu Dajie) but it turned out to be a theater instead. After asking a teenager for some help we attracted quite a crowd of teens who seemed fascinated by the description and idea (which was totally unknown to them) but they too were unable to help. I have a suspicion we have planted the seed of curiosity with them at the least.

As the sun began to set we talked through a city park containing the ruins of the city wall from the Ming Dynasty. With people clapping, walking dogs and flying kites, it was a peaceful stroll.
