<p>Seen recently in some Mefi comments: <em>podcasting: cb radio without the RF</em>.</p><p>I've been quietly downloading podcasts and not listening to them for a good 10 months now. Interestingly, this is one area where the technology is with, if not beyond, the ideas - there's no 'one day portable players will be able to...' excuse here; a music player or recent cell phone works just fine. The problem, to my mind, is the content that's out there. Sure, it can be entertaining to listen to a range of characters putting together their own radio shows, but I'm not finding myself that bored just yet. Half an hour of NPR in the morning is about all I can fit into my day. But maybe that's just me.</p><p>Of course, perspectives change. It's good to see the beeb jumping on board with a bunch of <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio4/mp3.shtml">Radio 4 programs</a> now available as download. I can listen to BBC radio instead of NPR without having the morning-shows-in-the-evening dilemma due to theï¿½8 hour difference. Bonus points for freeing us poor listeners from RealPlayer too.</p>
