First snowboarding outing of the season yesterday. Sean and I arrived at Alpental by 9am to a scene of heavy snowfall and at least 6&quot; of fresh powder. Great to get back on the board again, even if it did involve an abrupt introduction to what exactly it means to 'get stuck in powder'.By early afternoon the snow was still falling, but the body no longer willing. Back at the car, over a foot of fresh snow since we arrived and it didn't look like it was going to stop any time soon. It's going to be a good season.
