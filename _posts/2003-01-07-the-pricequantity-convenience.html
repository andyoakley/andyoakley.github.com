<p>In the supermarket today I noticed a strange, yet well known, trend in pricing different quantities of the same product. I can get my toothpaste in small, medium or large tubes, with prices to match, where the savings are better for the larger containers. Toilet rolls too - $4.49 for six rolls, $4.89 for nine. Generally, I can understand - I'm not too thirsty, so I won't get a supersize Coke today. But really, how is there any money to be made from selling the lesser quantities of repeated items? It's not like I'm going to stop needing toothpaste when this tube has run out, so who chooses to 'save' a few cents to in fact waste several more, generate extra waste and force a return trip soon. The American Dream - fuelled by the senseless consumers. </p><p>At the most unlikely moment today, while buying eggs, I realized why the lines 'Que sera sera' and 'Whatever will be will be' follow each other in the Doris Day song. I truly can't say how I used to think the former line was spelt, but I can't help shake the feeling that somewhere I saw the words written on a product or poster just prior to that moment and the penny finally dropped.</p>
