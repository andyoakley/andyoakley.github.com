<p>Another busy couple of days, and not too much to report for it. Most problems at work are now resolved, so at least that should calm down somewhat.</p><p>I watched <a href="http://us.imdb.com/Title?0125664">Man on the Moon</a> tonight which I thought was fantastic.</p><p>The D.C. Sniper case continues to unfold, albeit rather <a href="http://msnbc.com/news/816566.asp">strangely</a>. It's certainly placing fear in the hearts of many; all of a sudden anyone is at risk just going about their daily business. To me that seems like a far more effective means of terrorism, but at this point I hesitate to jump on the bandwagon and attribute these events to 'international terrorism'.</p><p>I see the human race now uses <a href="http://wcs.org/humanfootprint">83% of the world's land surface</a> for our various activities. Although I generally hate to use film quotes,<div><i>&quot;I'd like to share a revelation that I've had during my time here. It came to me when I tried to classify your species and discovered you humans aren't really mammals. Every mammal on this planet instinctively develops a natural equilibrium with the surrounding enviornment but you humans do not. You move to a location and multiply, and multiply, until every natural resource has been consumed. And the only way you can survive is to spread to another area. There is another organism on this planet that follows the same pattern. Do you know what it is? A virus. You human beings are a disease, a cancer of this planet. You are a plague, and we are the cure.&quot; </i></div>One has to wonder, with the current use of fossil fuels, global warming and increasing <a href="http://www.yankton.net/stories/102302/opE_20021023047.shtml">nuclear threats</a>, where will we stand in 30 years time?</p>
