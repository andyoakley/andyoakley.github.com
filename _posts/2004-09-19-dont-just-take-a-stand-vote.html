<p>My H1-B visa extension was approved today. My days of being an illegal alien (all twenty of them) have come to a close and I'm now legally permitted to live and work in the US for another three years.</p><p>But I still can't vote. With it�being election season and being bombarded by political propaganda from all directions,�it's a little frustration. What was it they�used to say?�'No taxation without representation'? What a novel idea. Still, I picked this lot�and�I'm sticking�with it. If you can, you should; <a href="http://www.registerandvote2004.org/adcampaign/index.asp">don't just take a stand, vote.</a></p>
