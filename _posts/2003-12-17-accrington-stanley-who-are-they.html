I was listening to the radio a couple of days ago and heard about Accrington Stanley <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/fa_cup/3314109.stm">getting through to the third round</a> of the FA Cup. For many years, I've thought their only contribution to popular culture was the lead up to the punch line 'exactly' in a particularly cheesy, yet memorable milk advert from years gone by.To think I never knew they were <a href="http://www.krysstal.com/league1889.html">one of founder members</a> of the Football League. I guess I wasn't following football in 1889.
