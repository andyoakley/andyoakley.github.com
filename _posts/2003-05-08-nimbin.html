The trip to Nimbin was a lot of fun. The party bus for <a href="http://www.jimsalternativetours.com/">Jim's Alternative Tour</a> (complete with full sound system and pumping melodies) took us out to what has to be one of the strangest little towns in the world. A couple of pots of Chai later, we headed on out to a massive botanical garden 'Hippy Heaven' planted some thirty years ago by a guy from New York, wanting to escape things in the States. I think he'd manage to escape too far. A final stop at the 100m Minyon Falls set the scene for the ride home and the day came to a close.Looks like the weather's going to be good today, which is handy; I'm going to go in a plane this afternoon.
