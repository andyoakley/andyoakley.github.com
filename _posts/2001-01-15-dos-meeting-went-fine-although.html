DoS meeting went fine, although I seem to have been mixed up with someone who didn't hand any work in and had precious hope of getting a third (who?). <br /><p>An excellent formal hall with very little to report unfortunately. Denis left early to retire to bed, otherwise, the bar was rather busy and entertaining. Garan is still yet to decide on his Microsoft job. There was a party going on at Edwina's rooms (a very spacious room, bigger than mine) but I wasn't too fused. Came back and listened to some music. Songs always seem to bring out the emotion lying just below the surface. Interesting that.
