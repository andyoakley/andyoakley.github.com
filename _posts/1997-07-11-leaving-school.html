<em>Taken from the Madagascar Team 1 Journal, originally by Kay</em>

After getting up at the ridiculous time of 5.30 am, re-packing rucksacks, strapping down everything that moved and plastering everything with silver tape, we were almost ready to set off. With much groaning and muttering, rucksacks were heaved onto backs for the short distance to the bus.

Our driver was the infamous Fabio - which was slightly worrying as he was also our driver during the Biology field trip, where he bus broke down three times. But we managed to reach Heatehrow airport in plenty of time and without any mishaps.

The rucksacks were manouvered into the airport and stacked in mountain-high piles with various people standing guard. Last minute shopping for me consisted of extra pairs of socks and some chocolate to take away the taste of aeroplane food (which was, of course, disgusting, but we haven't even got on the plane yet). Nat and Suzanne bid farewell to their blokies (very sweet, aahh).

Next was passport control and customs. Everything was fine untile Charley went through with the pade. She was releived not to have to explain why she was carrying a spade - she might have received a few strange looks.

We proceeded to look at the departures board, which calmly told us that the last call for our light was 8 minutes ago. We of course, being the organised and structured team that we are, did not panic, but made our way to the departure lounge in a quick-march. No-one got on the plane for another hour, but never mind.

Eventually we got on Flight BD0177 and took off. Pokey coped admirably well with his first flight ever, which was quite disappointing. I could have done with something exciting to write. Never mind.

Food on the plan was, as predicted, only barely edible. The airlne conveniently forgot about there being any vegetarians on board, so Suzanne and Catherine probably had to fight for their meals. At lease the chocolate was OK though.

We reached CDG more or less on time, and as we were getting off, the crew gave us a good luck message over the tanoy system which was very nice, even if repeating it in French was a bit pointless.

Next shock of the day was being spoken to in French. OK, so we were in France, but it was still a shock. We took over a little shuttely-bus-thing to get to the next terminal, then had a look round the French duty free shops.

We eventually boarded - except they'd forgotten to attach a plane to the end of the shuttely-connecty thing.

Anyway, this is getting amazingly boring, so I'll just do a few more points:The stewardess didn't speak English (well didn't to me anyway) I was surrounded by French scouts and other frogs who kept trying to talk to me. I have forgotten every word of French I know (which wasn't much to start with) We had an hours wait to refuel at Munich - this really reflects the attitude in Madagascar - laid back to the point of horizontal No food till 11.30pm!! Don't they realise we get hungry before then?

SLEEP
