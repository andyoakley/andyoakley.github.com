<p>It's always good having family to visit when you live a long way from that�nebulous place called home.�My cousin Steve and his fiance Natalie just spent a week of vacation in Seattle and we had a great time. Mostly good weather, barbecues on the sun deck, a Mariners game, an alarming number of trips to Starbucks (even for a Seattle resident), a trip to Snoqualmie Falls and some general time to catch up made for a well-spent week. As I write this they'll be in NYC and are no doubt having fun in the big city, a point about which I am quite jealous.</p><p>The <a href="http://www.kollenkark.com/images/june25/">pictures of the bar games�from Friday night</a> don't really do the week justice, but it's always fun seeing <a href="http://www.kollenkark.com/images/june25/PictureView.aspx?pid=22">little lady</a> conclusively beat a <a href="http://www.kollenkark.com/images/june25/PictureView.aspx?pid=32">big man</a>�at <a href="http://www.kollenkark.com/images/june25/PictureView.aspx?pid=7">Indian leg wrestling</a>. And who knew, you can get Pimms &amp; Lemonade at the bar just down the street. </p>
