<p>The <a href="http://news.independent.co.uk/world/politics/story.jsp?story=379623">speculation</a> that Iraq may have stowed weapons on three cargo ships that are currently aimlessly circling international waters has not exactly made headline news. I'm surprised, the networks would usually be pumping this out hourly, right alongside the ridiculous 'TERROR ALERT: HIGH' overlay. Maybe this will pan out into something more, maybe not.</p><p>It reminds me of the story of disinformation created during WWII, some of which persists to this day. Carrots improve your eyesight? I think not. To keep the Germans from figuring out that Britain had developed radar, it 'became' common knowledge that fighter pilots were being fed significant quantities of the vegetable to improve night vision, thus creating a plausible yet hollow justification for their dramatic improvement in success rate.</p>
