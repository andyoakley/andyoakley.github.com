..Text has been a great blogging engine for a few years now but its relative stagnation (as work transferred to Community Server) has left me looking for more. Meanwhile MSN Spaces has come a really long way since its Japanese pilot and is really starting to look good.<br /><br />Combine that with my new Treo 700 which makes writing mails on the move really easy (like this one) and it's a recipe for success.
