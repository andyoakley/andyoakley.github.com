You're going to need it.</p><p><a href="http://www.boingboing.net/2004/11/03/kerry_concedes.html">Boing Boing</a>: Four more years of a nation led by criminals. I was making coffee with one eye on CNN when the news broke, and I called my dad, a man who's spent many years fighting for good things, sometimes at great personal cost. &quot;Get over it,&quot; he said, &quot;The way you feel now is exactly how I felt when Nixon won a second term -- crushed. I couldn't believe America was that stupid. But remember what happened to Nixon that term.&quot;</p><p>"As a British citizen, I just can't understand why. Does the British media unfairly portray Bush, or are more than half of American voters just fucking stupid?"</p><p>When told, &quot;well, if you don't like it then move somewhere else&quot; the friend's reply would be, &quot;What? And become a victim of our foreign policy?&quot; </p><p><a href="http://weblog.siliconvalley.com/column/dangillmor/archives/010985.shtml">Dan Gillmor</a>: We will not recognize America in four more years. That will make half of America giddy. It will terrify the other half. </p><p><a href="http://www.sorryeverybody.com/">Sorry Everybody</a>�[picture]</p><p>�</p>
