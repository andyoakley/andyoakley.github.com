<p>I'm sitting on the 242 bus on my way to work. Most commuter lines in Seattle are now wifi-enabled which makes for an fairly efficient use of the 45 minutes each way. A chance to catch up on the mail of the day without having to stay in the office until late.</p> <p>What makes today's journey different is that we just missed a turn onto 51st. No big deal if you're in a car but it's somewhat harder to pull a U-turn in an articulated bus. So there's a process for this: call a supervisor, they establish your position and then have a list of reroutes (with large, sweeping turns, presumably) to get you back on track. I'd guess they do the same for road closures, accidents, floods, snow&nbsp;and the all. </p> <p>Given it's a Friday and on Friday traffic is always light, I'll be at work on time. And tomorrow I'm going on vacation so a little scenic detour in the morning is fine by me.</p>
