Filing a millimetre of wood off of the bottom of their chair legs every day, switching the regular and decaf, moving furniture around ever so slightly, shrinking clothes a little bit each week. In fact, there must be a list on the internet somewhere, but I've not looked.</p><p>My own personal experience in this field is my commute. In moving to Seattle from Redmond (which was undoubtedly one of my best decisions of late), I now spent anywhere between a thirty minutes to an hour getting to and from work, each way, every day. That time, relaxing as it sometimes may be, is not what I consider to be my own. At first a novelty, then a habit, now a chore, I'm now wondering how much of my mental wellbeing is left behind while sitting in traffic of Lake Washington.</p><p>I'm fairly convinced teleworking is never quite going to cut it. Depending on day-to-day responsibilities, it may work for some, but not nearly the majority. I have all the prerequesites in place, and may very well be 'productive' working in isolation in a selfish sense, but it'll be a long time before it fills the need for face-to-face communication.</p><p>Why haven't they invented a teleporter yet?</p>
