<p>From <a href="http://www.pocket-lint.com/news/43935/hzo-waterproof-nano-tech-samsung-apple">Samsung and Apple looking at new waterproof smartphone tech</a>, I thought this was a great example of how to make an impression. Figure out how your product improves someone else's, demonstrate it, and show them. No explanation needed.</p>

<blockquote>We showed the Samsung Chairman the technology with a Samsung Galaxy S that we had coated with HZO and he couldn't believe his eyes," a representative of the company told us. "Samsung is really excited by the tech."</blockquote>
