Barely back in Seattle for a quick change of clothes after the Tabernash adventure and we were on the road again, this time taking a trip back to England to see family and friends, attend a wedding and a garden party.

It was really great spending time with people I hadn't seen in far too long and getting a chance to catch up with those things that make 'home' feel like home. May I present a selection:

Old buildings. Kenilworth Castle in this case.

A real chip shop. Yes, that does read 'Fish and chips fried in beef dripping'. No fish and chips on this trip but I did rather enjoy a shopping tour around Morrisons - twiglets, cherry bakewells, malt loaf, real Cadburys chocolate, party rings and other assorted goodies.

Staffordshire Oatcakes. Great breakfast to fuel a day of 24 hours of traveling on the way home.

A feast of home-grown vegetables. Mum has been doing some great work in her allotment.

A trip to the Jephson Gardens in Leamington

In just ten days we also packed in an excursion to Venice and were honored to be joined by family and friends for a UK-based pre-wedding garden party. More on those to follow.
