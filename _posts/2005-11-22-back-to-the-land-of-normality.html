<blockquote>&quot;The more we do, the more we can do; the more busy we are, the more leisure we have.&quot; -- Dag Hammarskjold</blockquote><p>The term 'death march' in software engineering has a number of definitions, depending on where you look. Almost all capture the notion that there's a lot of work to do and too little time, money, resources or all of the above. Not all end in disaster, but given the constraints it's understable to see why so many do. In those cases where success emerges, the satisfaction of the achievement is surpassed only be the knowledge that it is done. More work will surely follow, but the hope that it will do so in a measured fashion shines eternal. </p><p>Suffice it to say, the last few months for me have not been without challenges. But as the holiday season starts with Thanksgiving this Thursday, I'm already on vacation and plan to make the very most of this time off. </p><p>Plenty has happened over the last few months and here are some of my personal highlights:</p><ul><li><a href="http://www.microsoft.com/windowsserversystem/applicationplatform/launch2005/default.mspx">Visual Studio 2005, SQL Server 2005 and BizTalk Server 2006 launches</a> all came to pass in November.
