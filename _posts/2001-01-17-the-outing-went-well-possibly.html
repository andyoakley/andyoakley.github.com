The outing went well, possibly the best yet of the term. We had a few strokes of teasing balance, but at least it's a start. I'm not particularly looking forward to a meeting with <b>everyone</b> that wants to row this term. Presumably a nightmare, but at least my first boat is shaping up.<br /><p>Lauren has pointed towards a rather entertaining <a href="http://dcbc.dow.cam.ac.uk/explorer/explore.asp?basedir=bumps">Bumps predictor</a> on DCBC's website. At least no-one thinks <a href="http://jcbc.jesus.cam.ac.uk">Jesus</a> will be a disgrace, unlike perhaps the likes of <a href="http://www.firstandthird.org">1st &amp; 3rd Trinity</a>.
