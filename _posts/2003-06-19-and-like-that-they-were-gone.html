I'm both puzzled and amused by the <a href="http://www.cheesebikini.com/blog/archives/000261.html">flash mobs</a> of NYC. I suspect the reason for such gatherings is as inexplicable to the participants as it is to the observers. What's the point? I'm not sure, but I've a feeling if I was in New York, I'd be there to see if I could find out.
