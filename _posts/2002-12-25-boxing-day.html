<p>Christmas Eve turned out to be very relaxed; I stayed around town, did a little shopping and generally a lot of nothing. </p><p>Today I went up to <a href="http://www.stevenspass.com">Stevens</a> again and spent the entire day boarding. Despite countless questions of 'are you a witness?' and 'why would you spent Christmas day here?' it was great.</p><p>I am dearly disappointed that I have to go to work tomorrow; surely it wouldn't hurt to observe <a href="http://www.snopes2.com/holidays/christmas/boxing.htm">Boxing Day</a>, the definitive occassion for recovering after the indulgence of the day before. That said, I have to confess a certain fondness for the 'Day After Thanksgiving' holiday if for no reason other than its imaginative name.</p>
