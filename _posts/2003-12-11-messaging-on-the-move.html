The US cell carriers are finally catching up with SMS text messages and people here are gradually picking up the habit. But it's taking time, and still doesn't come cheap ($.25 per international message!).Help is at hand! MSN Messenger makes it really easy to send text messages when people aren't online. Tools/Options/Phone has a `Mobile Device' section. Set up your `Mobile Settings' with a phone number and back in Messenger 'allow people on your contact list to send messages'.Free stuff rocks.
