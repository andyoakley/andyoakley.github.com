<p>Today did not go according to plan. I woke up with a serious hangover, which disrupted just about everything. I spent a couple of hours in McDonalds on Alaskan Way, enjoying some writing and people watching (next to the ferry terminal). That restaurant has got to be heading towards one of the least clean I've ever known.</p><p>I watched two very different films this evening <a href="http://www.imdb.com/Title?0241303">Chocolat</a> and <a href="http://www.imdb.com/Title?0284837">Ali G in da house</a>. The former was good, but left me unsure why I'd just spent two hours watching it. The latter just jogged a few memories, like humour, what England looks like, and Jon Snow on Channel 4. </p>
