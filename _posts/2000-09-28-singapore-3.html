<p><i>Taken from Lauren's diary of our trip to South East Asia</i></p><p>We got up at 6am, checked out, had breakfast and got a taxi to KL station. We got on a train to Singapore and passed through Customs &amp; Imigration at the border where we had to get off the train and pass by a series of men and dogs. We met a man on the train on his way to Singapore to go to an old-peoples home. He was born in Penang and was a British soldier in WWII. He recommended the hotel we had booked (coincidence). We got a taxi to the hotel which was nice. We went to Orchard Road on the MRT and looked at digital video camera for Andy. Came back to the hotel. Andy reconfirmed our flights home. We went to the Coffee Bean near our hotel for tea. Hotel, shower, TV.</p>
