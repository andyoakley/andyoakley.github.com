Today it rained. Yet another early morning, however they do seem to be getting easier. It was Nat's birthday so Hannah woke early in a panic to attach baloons to Nat's tent. On this particularly special occasion we had a fab breakfast of chapatis with jam/peanut butter and tinned fruit - wow! No eggs this morning as the village only had four, 2 week old eggs which we declined to try

Again we were late setting off after foot inspections, tent distmantling and general pratting about. We actually made our objective today after finding the terrain a lot less testing. Jean-Pierre actually seemed a little tired today - he is human after all. Today's challenges involved several river crossings. The guides found our preparations hilarious - taking off boots, waterproofing kit. The locals also became our audience and found us particularly amusing. The major river crossing had water coming up to most of our waists - Sam's bum. Nat looked as though she was wearing a nappy.

Towards the end of the day, no-one could be bothered to remove their boots so we splashed through much to the disgust of the first aid officers who worried about the problem of athelete's foot etc.

The conversation of the day appeared after the major river crossing when Catherine (Saffy) asked for the shovel. Ben was foolish enough to ask why she needed it "I don't wish to walk around with a wet sanitary towel for the rest of the day". To answer this Ben was foolish to say the word "pardon" to which Catherine repeated everything.

Dinner for a change was soup and rice at the end of one of the only climbs of the day. Biscuit levels are getting low but we did have Laughing Cow cheese today. Group 2 (Pokey, Sal, Suzanne and Saffy) cooked a banquet for dinner including tuna, noodles, rice (what a surprise) and spinach/cabbage. We camped on a beach which could have been a wee bit embarrassing when it began to piss it down enabling the possibility of being washed away to become apparent. The river water was particularly clean with a friendly pig merrily excreting crap into the water.
