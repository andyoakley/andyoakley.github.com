The initial draw placed Ethan with a strong foothold in North America, Sean is Europe and me picking up the remainder in South America, Africa and Australia. The people of my strongholds proved themselves to be valiant warriors and after five hours of intense action, Sean's 'never lost at Risk' streak came to an end. The world leaders in attendance were swayed by both the changing fortunes of the balance of power as well as the exotic appeal of�Tecate, Pacifico and Jack Daniels.</p><p>Victory!</p>
