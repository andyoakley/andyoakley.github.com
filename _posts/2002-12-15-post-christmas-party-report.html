<p>Needless to say, I had had a few drinks before my previous post, and have had several more now.</p><p>The party was good, and I followed the <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/1056116.stm">guidelines</a> and <a href="http://www.bcentral.com/articles/krotz/158.asp">rules</a> almost to the letter.</p><p>Indeed, from one of those articles <br /><div>But office parties are very self-regulating. If a staff member is making a fool of themselves, someone more senior will usually say 'Look, behave yourself, the boss is just over there'</div><br />This had special meaning tonight; with my manager singing <a href="http://www.lynchnet.com/bv/bluevelvet.html">Blue Velvet</a> before the five hundred of us. </p><p>She has a fantastic voice, one that I'd never really appreciated amidst our many conversations. </p>
