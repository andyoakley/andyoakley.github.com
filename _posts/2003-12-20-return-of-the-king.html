Thoroughly enjoyed the final part of <a href="http://www.lordoftherings.net/">The Lord of the Rings</a> trilogy last night. Some long films feel like long films, but this three and half hour epic was enjoyable throughout.No spoilers here, but suffice it to say it's a spectacular experience that does justice to the book. Recommended.
