There's a book titled 'How Would You Move Mount Fuji?' which, while several years old now, looks into some of the types of interview questions used at Microsoft to find the creative thinkers and problem solvers as part of the interview process.

That class of questions are generally hypothetical and rarely reflect things that have precedent in the real world. Imagine then, my delight, at finding actual evidence of 'pausing' a river flowing at 4 million cubic feet of water/minute.

Cool pictures too.

From <a href="http://m.ammoth.us/blog/2010/03/absent-rivers-ephemeral-parks/">Mammoth</a>:
<blockquote>For six months in the winter and fall of 1969, Niagara’s <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Falls">American Fall</a>s were <a href="http://www.niagarafrontier.com/dewater.html">“de-watered”</a>, as the Army Corps of Engineers conducted a geological survey of the falls’ rock face, concerned that it was becoming destabilized by erosion.  During the interim study period, the dried riverbed and shale was drip-irrigated, like some mineral garden in a tender establishment period, by long pipes stretched across the gap, to maintain a sufficient and stabilizing level of moisture.  For a portion of that period, while workers cleaned the former river-bottom of unwanted mosses and drilled test-cores in search of instabilities, a temporary walkway was installed a mere twenty feet from the edge of the dry falls, and tourists were able <a href="http://www.niagarafrontier.com/image/Amfallsdewatered3.jpg">to explore</a> this otherwise inaccessible and hostile landscape.</blockquote>
