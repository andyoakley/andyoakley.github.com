<p>Today was the RTM (release to manufacturing) of the Japanese version of Visual Studio 2005 and SQL Server 2005. Following the English launches in late October, today represented our second big content push of the year with over 250,000 Japanese documents being published onto msdn2. Lots of hard work, a few close calls and we're well positioned to be rolling out German, Italian, Chinese and several other languages over the next four weeks. </p><p><a href="http://msdn2.microsoft.com/ja-jp/library/">Japanese MSDN2 Library</a></p>
