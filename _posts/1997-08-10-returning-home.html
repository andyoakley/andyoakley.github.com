<em>Taken from the Madagascar Team 1 Journal, originally by Pokey</em>

With Sam deposed, Charley took over the role of leader for our final day on Madagascar's shores. We had breakfast in a cafe across the road from the Hotel Anjary and then split into 2 groups. One group's task was to retrieve the luggage, which had been left in the Hotel Cappucino for us. The other group set abot getting transport to the airport and buying souvenirs. With my rucksack being one of those left on the runway, I went with the first group, but I was sceptical as to how many rucksacks we'd fnd. Thankfully, a full completement of rucksacks were found, along with a note from Nanah. He'd been earlier to collect his belongings and would see us later. The joy well-done, we also set about buying souvenirs. Bottles of Three Horses, T-shirts from Le Champion supermarket and an excellent tin Air Madagascar plane would perhaps remind me more of the grountry and my sparsely-clad wrestlers.

We had lunch in the Hotel Colbert where the steak and crisps for main course and strawberry juice came highly recommended. Here, Nanah reappeared and gave Martin a boat whilst we thanked him with some bicycle lights.

We left "the vibrant city with some crazy characters" behind and travelled to the airport for 3.00 pm with out flight at about 9.00 pm. We queued for ages and there was a moment of panic when this very journal was lost, but thankfully retrieved shortly from a member of the airport security staff.

Once airbourne, and being a Sunday, we completed the final round of the Sunday night Pub Quiz.

To cut the long, long journey short, we landed in Nairobi where we all stayed on the plane and agin in Charles de Gaulle, Paris where we didn't. We reached Heathrow at about 1.00 pm (Monday 11th) where we all bid fond farewells to Suzanne. Relieved to find the trusty Bassetts' bus ON TIME we embarked and soon found ourselves sipping ice cold milk and chewing rather nice (blue!) Allsorts at a service station amidst the metropolis that is Birmingham. It being 5.00 pm and we being ahead of schedule, we telephoned our loved ones to be picked up at 6.00 pom. All were pleased to speak to their parents, except Mike, who, much to his disgust found that steak and chips awaited him at home. All eagerly awaited a hot bath and a comfortable bed.

We were finally there. Home.
