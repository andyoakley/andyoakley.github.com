Good meal at the <b>Dome</b> as always. Seems <b>Ed Pain</b> wants to row this term. Timely as always, but certainly an asset.<br /><p>I've had a thorough overhaul of <a href="http://www.formalhall.com">formalhall.com</a> this evening. It's in a far more manageable state now. Just need to get some more pictures coming in...<br /><p>Not wanting to get behind again, I've just made the trivial purchase of <a href="http://apoakley.com">apoakley.com</a>. I'm sure it'll be useful one day...
