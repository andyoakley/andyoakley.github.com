Wedding season is in full swing. This last weekend saw us flying in to Denver and then driving up to Tabernash, Colorado just past Winter Park for a family wedding at Devil's Thumb Ranch.

At a mere 9000ft, even simple things like a walking around leave you winded. The temperature range is quite marked too, from 40F degrees at night to probably 90F during the day with intense sun. The scenery is fabulous, however.

Friday night was a Western-themed barbecue at Heck's Tavern and perhaps the most fabulous collection of bolo ties ever assembled in a single place.

The ceremony and reception were a real treat too. As was the very impressive owner's house in which we stayed. Overall, a great weekend all round.
