<p>We took aï¿½trip to the newly-opened <a href="http://www.monkey-forest.com/">Monkey Forest</a> at Trentham Gardens this morning to see some of the Barbary Macaques. Despite a expectation level-setting of 'we might not see any', the place was packed full of primates eating, playing, chasing and grooming. Great fun.</p><p><a href="http://www.andyoakley.com/mypictures/Default.aspx/Monkey Forest at Trentham Gardens (Dec 2005)">Photos of the Monkey Forest at Trentham Gardens</a>.</p>
