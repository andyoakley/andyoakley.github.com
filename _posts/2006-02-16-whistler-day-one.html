<p>Despite our best efforts, a seven am start was the best we could muster after a late-evening outing to Fado. We made decent time, breakfast at McDonalds, five minutes at the border and an easy drive up to Whistler.</p><p>Rentals and passes were all easy and we were on the mountain before one pm. Snow is so-so, no powder, but it's not icy or bullet proof and quite enjoyable. It's wickedly cold too. Dave and I got plenty of runs into today and found the skills came back quickly enough.</p><p>Our accommodation is decidedly palace-like with plenty of space, lots of bedrooms, a nice big gathering room and a tiny hot tub which still managed to hold the six of us. Very pleased there.</p><p>Great home-made spaghetti for dinner and now the fresh air is starting to go to my head. It will be a quiet night.</p><p><a href="http://www.andyoakley.com/mypictures/Default.aspx/Snowboarding at Whistler (Feb 2006)">Photos of Snowboarding at Whistler</a></p>
