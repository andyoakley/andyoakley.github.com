Rattlesnake Lake is a place I've heard several times but had never been to. There's free fishing across Washington this weekend and since this lake is only about 45 minutes out of Seattle, it seemed like a great place to spend a few hours.

Despite record high temperature in Seattle earlier this week (I think it broke ninety degrees), today was much more overcast with some heavy rain on the ride up. It was dry when we arrived, but hardly warm enough to be sitting around on the shore with a rod in hand, so we decided to hike up to Rattlesnake Ledge which overlooks the lake.

It's a fairly easy hike up about 2 miles with several switchbacks and a fairly gentle grade through trees. The trail is well kept and while there were quite a lot of people enjoying it, it wasn't too busy.

We'll go back.
