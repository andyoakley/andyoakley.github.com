<p>Yesterday I drove the 20,000th mile in my truck. It's about 18 months old now and I still feel that my pre-purchase research has paid off well. No complaints - I've taken it through snow, sand, dirt, rocks and plenty of miles on the highway and barring one case of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Engine_knocking">engine pinging</a>, there have been no problems. The great service at <a href="http://www.fordofkirkland.com">Ford of Kirkland</a> has to be commended too and maintenance really has been rather simple because of that.</p><p>It has to be said, automobiles have changed. While disassembling my first Mini while trying to troubleshoot the loss of power, I certainly learned a lot about the internal combustion engine and its implementation. Apparently, these days it's all quite different - the knocking was fixed with a simple update to the on-board timing computer. I can understand it, I just can't quite believe it. Technology is starting to get away from me.</p><p>Anyway, all this to say that I got a new <a href="http://www.rolltopcover.com/">Retrax bed cover</a> installed yesterday. It's low profile and seems to fit really well as well as beingï¿½lockable, weatherproof and easy to adjust. Looks good so far.</p>
