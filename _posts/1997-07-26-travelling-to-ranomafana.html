We got up and packed early and ready to go. 20 packs and 20 people, expecting a large and roomy Mazda Van, however, a little Nissan Van arrived. Sardines, definitely packed live sardines. We all had a bumpy journey along the track out of Tsaratanana towards Ranomafana. We all sat perched on our rucksacs bouncing up towards the roof as we hurtled over the bumps.

At Afannadine, we stopped to stock up on chocolate, which is of course much more important than things like petrol. After about 10 minutes in Afannadine we all piled back into the truck and back along a flat tarmac road towards Ranomafana. Many tortured faces as we bumped and banged around the back of the van.

We were dropped off at the 'Hotel Manja'. About 20 raised wooden bungalows, 6 of which we occuppied. Lunch was in the hotel restaurant, real meat and non-gritty good was very welcome, as was a cold drink.

We spent the afternoon visitng the thermal baths. Warm water was heavenly, and the clean, hot shower very much needed. All clean and refreshed we wandered back to the hotel. Between returning and dinner a group of us wandered into town to look for souvenirs. We were desperate to buy hats but a bit dubious as to whether they would survive Isalo.

In the evening we all ate together in a rather small room, and after a good meal started the quiz, Bernard losing their lead. After an enjoyable evening a soft matress was very soothing as was the comfort of the mosquito net. Our day of return to civilisation.
