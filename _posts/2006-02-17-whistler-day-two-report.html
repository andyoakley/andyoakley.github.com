<div>Lots of good boarding yesterday. We spent all day on Whistler, riding the Dave Murray run and coming over the Saddle in some crazy 60 kph winds giving a temperature of -50C at the peak. After a truly difficult moguled run down, we took an early lunch at Dusty's in Creekside followed by a quick trip up to the top to recover birthday-boy Adam and rode back out to the base for a huge plate of nachos.</div><div>�</div><div>A few more runs and we were ready to exercise the ski-in feature of the condo which worked as promised. A few drinks in the hot-tub, a fantastic nap and a we were ready to make for the village. Fine dinner at 21 Steps followed by drinks at Wild Bill's; all good.</div><div>�</div><div>As things are a little shaky this morning, Dave and I are about to head out to Creekside for some big breakfast before tackling Blackcomb today.</div>
