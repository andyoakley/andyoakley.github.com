<p><i>Taken from Lauren's diary of our trip to South East Asia</i></p><p>We still had burnt and sore feet. Had breakfast. It rained. We watched TV and played chess.

Andy went for a swim in the sea - he has a very big blister on his foot and managed to catch a large jellyfish on his arm. Lauren read her book. Dinner.</p>
