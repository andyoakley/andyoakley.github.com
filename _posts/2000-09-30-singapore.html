<p><i>Taken from Lauren's diary of our trip to South East Asia</i></p><p>Got up and had breakfast in the hotel. Checked out. We got the MRT to City Hall and wandered around Raffles City shopping centre and went for a walk to see a War Memorial, Cenotaph and Raffles' landing site. Then we went to Raffles Hotel. We wandered around Raffles Arcade (posh shops) and then went to the Long Bar and had a Singapore Sling. We went back to our hotel on the MRT, showered and went to the airport in a taxi. We checked in.</p>
