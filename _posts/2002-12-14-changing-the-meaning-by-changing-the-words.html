<p>I just heard about <a href="http://www.cleanflicks.com">CleanFlicks</a> on the TV. This is ridiculous - this company is making money by taking films and editing them for easily-offended population. Surely you change the entire meaning of a film by filtering out such 'extreme' content. Apparently the version of 'Good Will Hunting' is selling without it's 139 F-words. Some people just don't get it.<br /><div>CleanFlicks is a family-oriented company based in Pleasant Grove, Utah. We love movies, but prefer to watch them without the sex, nudity, profanity or extreme violence. Because we recognize others may have a similar desire, we provide this editing service to you. Our mission is to provide access to Hollywood entertainment free from objectionable elements, thus helping maintain high moral values.  </div></p>
