<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thanksgiving">Thanksgiving</a> is a great American holiday. It remains�probably the last�uncommercialized occassion for sharing with friends and family and time to reflect on many things, among them how lucky we are. And there are very few things with that premise that one could disagree with. </p><p>Today, however, was slightly different as we're putting of the gorging until tomorrow. Instead, today was a trip to <a href="http://www.cityofanacortes.org/Parks/WaPark/wa_park.htm">Washington Park</a> near Anacortes, one of the undiscovered gems of the northwest. Despite the rain in Seattle the shadow of the�Olympics made for�sunshine�on top of the bitterly cold wind and perfect conditions for a bike ride. Fun.</p><p>Meanwhile, as the hoards descend on the shopping malls tomorrow morning at the ridiculous hour of five for the start the sales that mark the start of the Christmas shopping season, Katie and I will be heading�up to <a href="http://www.visitlakechelan.com/photos/index.html">Lake Chelan</a> for a couple of days at the <a href="http://www.stehekin.com/">Stehekin Lodge</a>. The only way in is by boat and there are no phones, TV or radio. We've a housekeeping unit that should provide everything we need for eating the massive quanitites of food we'll prepare tonight. It's going to be a good weekend.</p>
