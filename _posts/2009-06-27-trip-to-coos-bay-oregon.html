Last weekend, a work commitment placed Amy in Coos Bay, Oregon on Sunday afternoon. Since it's a decent seven hour drive, we decided to go together and make a weekend of it. Setting off on Friday evening, we stayed in Eugene overnight and continued further south on Saturday.

As we passed through Reedsport, OR we couldn't give up the opportunity to stop by the annual chainsaw carving festival.

We camped overnight at Sunset Bay, a fine campground located a short walk from the ocean and plenty of opportunities to explore:

Overall it was a 900 mile round trip, more than seven hours each way for just a weekend, but overall well worth it.
