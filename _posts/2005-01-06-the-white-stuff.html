<p>Today happens to be Sean's birthday. Happy birthday, <a href="http://kollenkark.com">Sean</a>. On this day last year, Seattle got a good few inches of snow and everything ground to a halt and it was great. Despite the conditions, we still managedï¿½to find a taxi (driven by an Ethiopian who had never seen snow) to take us up to O'Sheas for the occasion.</p><p>I've no idea how tonight will unfold. Please let it snow.</p>
