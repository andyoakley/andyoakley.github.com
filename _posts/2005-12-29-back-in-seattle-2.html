<p>And like that, ten days have just flown by. It was good to catch up with the family over Christmas Eve and Christmas Day and feast to excess, twice. Time at home is always a great way to wind down, do little and generally regain that energy that seems so fleeting during normal life.</p><p>My flight back was easy enough despite feeling absolutely exhausted in O'Hare. The jetlag proved useful for once and early rising makes it easy to head off to work just hours after touching down. Redmond is deserted, Seattle is pretty quiet and it's a good time to catch up on (some obscenely) long overdue e-mails.</p>
