Now that's got me thinking about safety of the homeland. I learnt two interesting things about the Spanish Armada of 1588 this week. <ol><li>The British long-barrel cannons called culverin or snake fired shot faster than the speed of sound. Don't get in the way. </li><li>The beacons used for the single message of 'I see them!' were effective, carrying the message from Plymouth to Carlisle in probably 40 minutes. I figure that's about <a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;oe=UTF-8&amp;q=400/40+miles+per+minute+in+miles+per+hour">600mph</a>.</li></ol>Ah the joys of the History Channel.
