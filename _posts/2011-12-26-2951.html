From the description of the <a href="http://www.boeing.com/commercial/777family/longer_range/index.html">Boeing 777</a>:

<blockquote>One of the newest members of the 777 family, <b>the 777-200LR Worldliner has the capability to connect virtually any two cities in the world nonstop</b>. It will carry more passengers and more revenue cargo farther than any other jetliner. Also, the 777-200LR can carry a full cargo load on routes where other airplanes are payload limited. This gives airlines the capability to carry the same number of passengers farther and with additional revenue-generating cargo.</blockquote>

Connect any two cities in the world nonstop. An immensely compelling yet succinct statement of ambition.
