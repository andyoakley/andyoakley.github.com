<p>I'm currently taking a little break during the intermission of <a href="http://us.imdb.com/Title?0056172">Lawrence of Arabia</a>. Great film so far.</p><p>As the snow has been steadily falling in the hills all week, I headed up to <a href="http://www.stevenspass.com">Stevens Pass</a> today. Although it's a <a href="http://mappoint.msn.com/directions.aspx?&amp;StartName=Seattle,+Washington,+United+States&amp;StartLocation=47.59980,-122.33456&amp;EndName=Skykomish,+Washington,+United+States&amp;EndLocation=47.69819,-121.37231&amp;DataSetLangID=USA,409&amp;RouteType=Quickest&amp;RouteUnit=Miles">two hour drive</a>, it was well worth it. They're still claiming early season conditions but there were no rocks at all, it was great. First time with my new equipment, which I'm now really very pleased with. I was delighted to discover I'm also not back at square one - after a few moments it came back quickly. That said, I'm still a long way off perfect (my aching body being a testament to that), but I've got high hopes for the season.</p><p>I'm debating making a return trip tomorrow; I'd like to, but I'm totally exhausted. We'll see.</p>
