<p><i>Taken from Lauren's diary of our trip to South East Asia</i></p><p>We had breakfast in the hotel. We sat down in the lounge and tried to sort out some of the days on the holiday as yet unaccounted for. We got a taxi to the airport and at the airport Andy phoned the Cool Point Hotel in the Cameron Highlands and booked two nights. We flew with Thai Airways to Phucket. A man picked us up at the airport and brought us to the Bang Tao Lagoon Bungalows. We had a quaint and quirky little bungalow. We went for a walk on the beach, had a shower and then dinner in the restaurant.</p>
