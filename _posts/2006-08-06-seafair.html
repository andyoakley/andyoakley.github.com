<div>Today I, like most of Seattle, made the trip to Lake Washington to watch the <a href="http://www.blueangels.navy.mil/">Blue Angels</a> air show as part of <a href="http://www.seafair.com">Seafair</a>. The I-90 bridge is closed for a few hours during the show which provides a fabulous viewing platform for the action. I've seen plenty of TV shows about the Blue Angels and their planes, but it's still quite a sight to behold in person. Watching a plane scream overhead into a purely vertical climb really is a marvel of aviation technology. Quite a different experience from a check ride in a Cessna, I imagine.</div>
