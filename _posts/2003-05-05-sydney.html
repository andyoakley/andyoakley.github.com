Yesterday was a blur. From the bus station, we picked up our bus tickets and booked space on the 2145 to Byron Bay this evening. It gets in at some point tomorrow morning, I'm yet to see whether the overnight bus is the solution to doing more stuff in less time.After getting some DayTripper passes, we decided to use Sydney's land transport system to the full. A trip to Kings Cross, lunch in a backpackers haunt called Krave, then on to Bondi Junction and the beach which had some decent surf despite the time of year. Back onto the bus up to Circular Quay, a ferry out to Manly, a ten minute dash through the town to see Manly Beach on the other side, back on the (same) ferry and off to the show. Which was fantastic. As the final night, with the conductor who will be the resident next year for the Sydney Symphony, it was a great performance to see. The reputation of the Sydney Opera House is well deserved.No plans for today, but I'm sure all the best adventures start that way..
