Going back through some older links, an opinion piece on CNN titled <a href="'http://www.cnn.com/2010/OPINION/02/08/rosen.texting.communication.teens/index.html?hpt=C2">Generation Text: FB me</a> was an interesting read:
<blockquote>I tried to reach my teenage daughter the other day. I left a voice mail, sent an e-mail message and finally texted her and told her to check both and call me back.

Seconds later, she texted back one letter: "K." She is 19 and has been sending and receiving upwards of 3,000 texts per month. One month, she hit 7,500! She is not unusual at all.</blockquote>
Dr. Rosen has some other interesting facts on his blog posts <a href="http://drlarryrosenmemyspaceandiblog.blogspot.com/2009/08/welcome-to-igeneration.html">Welcome to the iGeneration</a>:
<blockquote>According to our research studies, Baby Boomers spend about nine and a  half hours daily with media, Generation Xers are immersed in media 15  hours per day and older Net Geners (18- to 29-years-old) consume nearly  20 media hours per day.</blockquote>
<blockquote>High school students spend upwards of 30 hours a week online, mostly for  entertainment and socializing with friends.  They spend one to two  hours a day communicating on social networks such as MySpace and Facebook.</blockquote>
<blockquote>A Harris Interactive national  survey of teens has even shown that 47% of the 2,089 nationally-sampled  teens could compose text messages blindfolded.</blockquote>
It is going to be fascinating to see how these habits, now  firmly entrenched, interact with the workplaces  of today. I wonder if the day of feeling out and out of touch is approaching.
