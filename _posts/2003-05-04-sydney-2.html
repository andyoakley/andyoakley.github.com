There's something truly amazing about world travel - I can leave Seattle one afternoon and arrive in Sydney the next morning. That's cool.Sydney seems like a fun place, there's plenty to see and do. Yesterday we saw the sights: the Sydney Opera House, crossing the Harbour Bridge and dining and drinking in Darling Harbour. Just booked last minute tickets for tonights performance of Beethoven Triumphant in the Concert Hall at the Opera House, so that should be great.Writing this from an internet cafe on the way to the bus station. Plans are to get an overnight to Byron Bay on Tuesday but nothing's fixed yet. Still got to visit Bondi Beach, Manly and Kings Cross while here in Sydney, so that's the order of the day.Photos to follow.
