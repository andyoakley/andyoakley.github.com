<p>We had a great dinner last night at the newly opened <a href="http://olivarrestaurant.com/">Olivar</a> restaurant on Capitol Hill.</p> <p>The food was excellent. A range of small and large plates of French/Spanish descent, with attention to detail in presentation and an assortment of Spanish wines. I particularly enjoyed the arugula, beet and goat cheese salad, the stuffed pork chop and the hanger steak.</p> <p>Interior decor was a pretty cool, the place was very busy for only its second week and a visit by a visibly-but-not-overtly-proud Chef Thomelin was a nice touch.</p> <p>(Footnote: I was mistakenly looking for 'Olivars' which seems to mean almost nothing on the web)</p>
