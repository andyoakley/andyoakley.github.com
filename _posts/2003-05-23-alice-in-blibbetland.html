Dr GUI recalls the tale of <a href="http://blogs.gotdotnet.com/drgui/PermaLink.aspx/25a3122a-3fb1-41da-a4f0-028046d1a690">Alice in Blibbetland</a>. The best parodies are only a hair's breadth from the truth.<blockquote>&quot;I'm not sure we can accept that,&quot; the manager declared. &quot;We need a date.&quot; &quot;But, &quot; Alice began, remembering what the rabbit told her about dates, &quot;a date is impossible.&quot; &quot;The least we can ask it that you give us a date when you will be able to give us the date for the date.&quot; stated the person in the corner. </blockquote>
