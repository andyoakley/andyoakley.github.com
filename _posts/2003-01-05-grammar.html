<p><p><p>The only thing really missing in the American lexicon is the word 'fewer'. Although hearing 'there are less people over there' irritates me, I can't help but think of it as progress.</p><p>For completeness<blockquote>Usage Note: The traditional rule holds that fewer should be used for things that can be counted (fewer than four players), while less should be used with mass terms for things of measurable extent (less paper; less than a gallon of paint). However, less is used in some constructions where fewer would occur if the traditional rule were being followed. Less than can be used before a plural noun that denotes a measure of time, amount, or distance: less than three weeks; less than $400; less than 50 miles. Less is sometimes used with plural nouns in the expressions no less than (as in No less than 30 of his colleagues signed the letter) and or less (as in Give your reasons in 25 words or less).</blockquote></p><p>I don't believe the English language will ever cease to amaze me with its long list of rules and equally lengthy set of exceptions. Why is it necessary to have two words that convey the same idea?  I'd better not get started on noun gender.</p></p></p>
