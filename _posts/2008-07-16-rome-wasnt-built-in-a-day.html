<blockquote>No matter what <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2008/05/22/the-empire-strikes-back-our-analysis-of-microsoft-live-search-cashback/">the pundits say</a>, the new <a href="http://search.live.com/cashback/?pkw=form=MXCA00/398bfe2157fb9b635c917f70d8506c67">Microsoft Cashback</a> program along with some continued efforts on other marketing programs such as <a href="http://club.live.com/Pages/Home/HomePage.aspx">Club Live</a> seem to have worked in June. <a href="http://www.live.com/">MSN/Live</a> search was the only major engine in June to post higher volumes of search queries. Everyone else, including the big dog <a href="http://www.google.com/">Google</a> (<a href="http://seekingalpha.com/symbol/goog">GOOG</a>), saw a decline. This seems even more impressive when you put this in the context of the overall search market. Overall search query volume in the market declined nearly 5% m-o-m, from 9.6 billion in May to 9.1 billion in June.</blockquote>
