<p>Looking back from the cameraphone pictures from the last few months is a great aid to memory. There's some stuff before this too like my parents' trip here in September but more on that later.</p><table><tbody><tr><td><img src="http://www.andyoakley.com/mypictures/Default.aspx/Moblog/2005-10-09-17-34-25.jpg?image=true&amp;size=128x98"></td><td>View from the Disney World Swan in Orlando in mid-October. The whole trip ended up being very last-minute, booking a flight a couple of days before and taking over the accomodation from a co-worker who sustained a back injury just before the conference and couldn't make the flight.</td></tr><tr><td><img src="http://www.andyoakley.com/mypictures/Default.aspx/Moblog/2005-10-10-18-57-10.jpg?image=true&amp;size=128x98"></td><td>Doing the demo/details part of the VSLive! keynote suddenly became very real with the issue of speaker's permit and T-shirt. Still, we've been seeing some of the very best of these new technologies so there was certainly no shortage of material.</td></tr><tr><td><img src="http://www.andyoakley.com/mypictures/Default.aspx/Moblog/2005-10-13-12-44-25.jpg?image=true&amp;size=128x98"></td><td>The first couple of days were spent preparing so I didn't get much opportunity to explore the Disney World. Thursday, Larry and I spent the day at the Epcot Center, taking in the sights, sounds and cuisine in a slightly-smaller-than-life rendition. The Mission to Mars ride was great but I wasn't as impressed with the Test Track.</td></tr><tr><td><img src="http://www.andyoakley.com/mypictures/Default.aspx/Moblog/2005-10-12-11-45-45.jpg?image=true&amp;size=128x98"></td><td>Time to start hooking up the laptops. With your display up on two twenty-foot screens, mandatory Windows patches and reboots and well as random 'Hello Werthers' IMs (thanks Ed :)) are good reminders that laptops need a little prep before a presentation.</td></tr><tr><td><img src="http://www.andyoakley.com/mypictures/Default.aspx/Moblog/2005-10-14-12-22-06.jpg?image=true&amp;size=128x98"></td><td>Conference done and a day to kill in Florida. The hotel had run out of rental cars so I headed back to the airport and rented one from there. It's about an hour's drive out to the Kennedy Space Center, complete with little alligators on the roadside. Even on a rainy (but hot!) day, I thoroughly enjoyed touring the history of the space program and the tour up to the launch sites. I had lunch underneath the booster section of the absolutely huge Saturn V that never left earth.</td></tr><tr><td><img src="http://www.andyoakley.com/mypictures/Default.aspx/Moblog/2005-10-26-23-38-53.jpg?image=true&amp;size=128x98"></td><td>If you really squint at this one, you can make out the 'W' logo in the center of the stage at the Key Arena. Weezer and The Foo Fighters played a great concert; lots of the old favorites and some surprises to boot.</td></tr></tbody></table>
