The claim is simple: <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/11/16/health/16really.html?_r=1">Drinking Water Before Meals Aids Weight Loss</a>. By filling the stomach with water before a meal, the sense of hunger is reduced and consumption falls correspondingly.

The 2007 study shows a difference in the effectiveness of this method dependent on age; little effect under age 35 with increased effectiveness in the older population. Does this really just come down to increased risk in the older population or some other hidden driver?

I'd love to see a longer term study over multiple years on this. Could the simplicity of this approach set it up to be easier to maintain as a simple healthy habit as opposed to a forced, non-enjoyable dieting behavior?
