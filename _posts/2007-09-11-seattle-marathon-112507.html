<p>It's been three years since Bob and I ran the New York Marathon and while ever since I've claimed to a 'runner', it's stretching the truth just a little. But things can change and nothing motivates like a real goal, so back in May I signed up for the full Seattle Marathon this coming November. Step 1 complete, goal defined.</p> <p>While back in the UK, it dawned on me that that date was a mere twelve weeks away and, as much as I'd wish it, my body isn't constantly in a state of readiness for the 26 mile adventure. And therefore now comes the training regimen. I'm going to become very familiar with the footpath around Green Lake in the weeks to come.</p>
