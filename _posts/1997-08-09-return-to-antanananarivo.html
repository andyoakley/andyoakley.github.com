<em>Taken from the Madagascar Team 1 Journal, originally by Sam</em>

Next day's target was to get back to Tana and involved getting to the airport in the morning. Everything went smoothly until it was time to get onthe plane when it became clear that through poor design, there was not enough luggage spce for all the passenger's luggage when the plane seats were full. Although I would have been happy to sit on my rucksack as we had had to do with every other transport we had been on, this was not allowed and we had to leave our luggage sitting on the runway, safe in the knowledge there would be another plane for it 'in a few hours'.

On landing in Tana we had to now retrieve our luggage. We did not have time to wait at the airport and we felt it was the airlines responsibility to have our luggage sent to our hotel, free of charge. However, the representative we spoke to was having none of this and it took some forceful persuasion from Suzanne to get them to agree.

We took a minibus from the airport, 'sans' most of our rucksacks, to the hotel in which we stayed in at the beginning of our expedition, Hotel Cappucine. However, on arriving it surfaced that no rooms had been booked and we would have to look for somewhere else. However, the owner offered the use of her phone to do this and we soon found somewhere in the other end of town. Next transport was taxis as we all trundled off o the Hotel Anjary.

Now settled in this hotel we still ad the problem of luggage. Half the group's luggage had actually fit on the plane but the rest of us were not able to change and had to go out in what we had been wearing for the past few days. As people were generally feeling better we decided to do the awards in the restaurant we ate in that night which, coincidentally, we shared with the other group. The awards and speeches were all performed and received with aplomb and all those involved should be praised.

Once again it was a depleted group that hit the clubs (Amnesia) with some ill, notably Suzanne who had been feeling off colour the past few days, but most tired.

The next day's jobs were to retrieve the luggage, which had arrived at the Cappucine late the previous evening, find Nanah who we had not seen in 24 hours and organise transport to the airport to go home. Thankfully all were done successfully and my unlucky reign as leader was finally over. I passed the crown on to Charley, safe in the knowledge I could chill all the way home.
