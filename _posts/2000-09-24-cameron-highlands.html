<p><i>Taken from Lauren's diary of our trip to South East Asia</i></p><p>Got up and had breakfast in the hotel. We went on a bus tour around the area. We visited a tea plantation (and bought some Boh tea), a butterfly farm, a bee farm, a strawberry farm and the Chinese Buddhists Temple. The butterflies were nice, and one landed on Lauren's back. Back to the hotel. We went for a walk and bought some souvenirs. Back to the hotel and watched some Olympics. We went to the Bunga Suria restaurant for dinner and had a traditional Indian meal served on a banana leaf and eaten with the right hand. It was good. We went to the Ranch bar for a drink and watched some more Olympics. Back to the hotel and had some vodka.</p>
