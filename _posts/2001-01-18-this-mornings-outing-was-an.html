This morning's outing was an absolute disgrace. I have scratched the crew from the race tomorrow, since it really wasn't worth the shame.<br /><p>My <b>Security</b> lecture was cancelled, so I wandered around town for a bit. I think I might buy <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/games/fs2000/default.asp">Flight Simulator 2000</a> since I've now got a computer well worthy of playing it on.<br /><p>Just sitting here now leafing through <a href="http://www.varsity.cam.ac.uk">Varsity</a> I've come across an excellent quotation<br /><blockquote><br /><i>The United States, I believe, are under the impression that they are 20 years in advance of Britain; whilst, as a matter of actual veritable fact, they are just about six hours behind it.</i><br />Harold Hobson<br /></blockquote>
