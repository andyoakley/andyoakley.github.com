<p><blockquote><br />I cannot say whether things will get better if we change; what I can say is they must change if they are to get better. --G. C. Lichtenberg<br /></blockquote><br />It looks as though the future will be a little different to how I perceived it yesterday, given recent developments at work. Suffice it to say that things will change drastically, but that change was not entirely unexpected.</p><p>Not one to hide behind quotations (believing those who do so are lacking the words to express themselves), here is my take. Change is great; to rest on what feels comfortable is a mistake. The world around us does not observe the same complacency, and a refusal to accept the inevitable does not avoid it, instead it merely places one in a far less advantageous position to deal with it. Accepting change as the rule rather than the exception is the best preparation for the adventure that lies ahead.</p>
