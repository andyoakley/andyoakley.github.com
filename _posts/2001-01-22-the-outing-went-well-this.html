It seems that <a href="http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~rja14">Ross Anderson</a> is still ill, so we've still not started <b>Security</b>. <br /><p>Watched <b>Neighbours</b> over lunch for the first time in months, nice to see not much has changed there...<br /><p>Off to circuits in a moment, but I think tomorrow I will go and buy a <a href="http://www.canon-europa.com/cgi-bin/parser.pl?page=products&amp;product=779&amp;prodtype=26&amp;subprodtype=27&amp;range=">scanner</a>.
