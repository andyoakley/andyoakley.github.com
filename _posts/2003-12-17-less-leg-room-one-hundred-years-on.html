There was such a fanfare about the centennial of <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2003/TRAVEL/12/17/first.flight/index.html">the first flight</a> on the news this morning. In fair and balanced mode, we should also remember <a href="http://www.wired.com/news/technology/0,1282,61611,00.html?tw=wn_techhead_5">Sir George Cayley</a>, a fine English gentleman who arguably beat them to it. Either way, the rumors of a big new space program announcement came to nothing.I'm fairly sure I knew Kitty Hawk was the place and not the lady that served tea to those inventive brothers, but you can never be certain.
