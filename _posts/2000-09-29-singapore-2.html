<p><i>Taken from Lauren's diary of our trip to South East Asia</i></p><p>We got the MRT to Orchard Road and finally bought a JVC digital video camera. We came back to the hotel and put the camera battery on to charge. We went to the McDonalds in the Singapore Post Centre (a shopping centre and post office) for lunch. We picked up the camera and got the MRT back to Orchard Road. We had ice cream in a Haagen-Dazs store. Andy videoed Lauren a bit. We walked down Orchard Road and on to Little India and did a walking tour that we found in a tourist leaflet. We bought two little wooden Buddha carvings. We had dinner in Pizza Hut and came back to the hotel on the MRT. We did a bit more videoing too. Andy played with his new toy.</p>
