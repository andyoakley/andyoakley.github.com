<p>For some time now, Anne has been reminding me to watch <a href="http://www.dickproenneke.com/">Alone in the Wilderness</a>. I recorded it on KCTS last night and have just been captivated while watching it. It's a truly remarkable tale of a man, Dick Proenneke, who sets out to spend a year in Alaska taking just a few bare essentials and a movie camera. Quoth the web site:</p><blockquote><p>To live in a pristine land unchanged by man... to roam a wilderness through which few other humans have passed... to choose an idyllic site, cut trees and build a log cabin... to be a self-sufficient craftsman, making what is needed from materials available... to be not at odds with the world, but content with one's own thoughts and company... Thousands have had such dreams, but Dick Proenneke lived them. He found a place, built a cabin, and stayed to become part of the country. This video &quot;Alone in the Wilderness&quot; is a simple account of the day-to-day explorations and activities he carried out alone, and the constant chain of nature's events that kept him company. </p></blockquote><p>Taking just a few tool heads (no handles - plenty of wood about), he steadily builds out a comfortable cabin to live in. On a big 15' by 20' foundation, walls of spruce logs and some very creative carpentry form a very impressive homestead. Catching fish, hiking through the snow and a life of total solitude paints a truly remarkable of one man's expedition into the back of beyond. Captivating viewing, but exercise caution if you get 'ideas' watching television like this.</p><img src="http://www.dickproenneke.com/images/proenekke/DickProennekeCabin.jpg">
