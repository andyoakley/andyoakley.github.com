Dave and I have just spent a thoroughly enjoyable four hours on IM trying to better each other with web sites that revive memories from years gone by. Even when the memories of a place may be vague, it's amazing how quickly they come flooding back so vividly from just a single photo or recollection.When young, a two storey building looks and feels like a skyscraper, playing fields seem to go on forever into the horizon, and walking distances always seemed further. Why does that size change so much as you get older?
