<p><div align="center">@img={d59071ec-61b8-4b8b-8fb0-3080be904802}</div><br /><i>In Flanders fields the poppies blow <br />Between the crosses row on row, <br />That mark our place; and in the sky <br />The larks, still bravely singing, fly <br />Scarce heard amid the guns below.</p><p>We are the Dead. Short days ago <br />We lived, felt dawn, saw sunset glow, <br />Loved and were loved, and now we lie <br />In Flanders fields.</p><p>Take up our quarrel with the foe: <br />To you from failing hands we throw <br />The torch; be yours to hold it high. <br />If ye break faith with us who die <br />We shall not sleep, though poppies grow <br />In Flanders fields.</i></p>
