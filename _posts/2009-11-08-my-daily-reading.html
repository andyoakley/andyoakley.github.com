A couple of my favorite reads right now are the <a href="http://blogs.harvardbusiness.org/hbr/">Harvard Business Review Voices</a> and <a href="http://blogs.reuters.com/felix-salmon/">Felix Salmon</a>. I thoroughly enjoyed listening to Stephen Dubner and Steven Levitt in Seattle earlier this week, and their NY Times blog <a href="http://freakonomics.blogs.nytimes.com/">Freakonomics</a> is always entertaining.

On the tech front, TechCrunch, Silicon Alley Insider, Mashable and ReadWriteWeb are good for general news. <a href="http://searchengineland.com/searchcap">SearchCap</a> from Search Engine Land has a good daily summary of the goings-on in the search world.

I wish I had more time to spend on fun things like Photoshop Tutorials at <a href="http://psdtuts.com/">psdtuts</a>, <a href="http://www.boston.com/bigpicture/">The Big Picture</a> and a bunch of other photography and PS blogs, but sadly they barely get read.

News mostly comes from Twitter these days which is both focused (good) and myopic (bad) at the same time. It helps having a job that makes me sensitive to large scale trends around breaking events.

A little fiction would be nice soperhaps that's something for the holidays.
