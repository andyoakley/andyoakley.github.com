I'm still cheating the jetlag with a fairly busy week so far. Vacations are great for putting a spring in the stride, even with the knowledge you've just used up two thirds of a vacation allowance. But imagine my delight at the discovery of <a href="http://www.skydivesnohomish.com">Skydive Snohomish</a>; hopefully I'll be jumping solo by the end of the summer.Looks like there's going to be a remake of <a href="http://www.italianjobmovie.com">The Italian Job</a> too. Whether or not such a venture can meet with success without Michael Caine remains to be seen and with the setting of Los Angeles, I'm wondering if they're remaking the right movie. Still, the new Mini is bound to go a long way to help.Finally, I am beginning to regret not importing more Mars Bars back from Australia. How can a world superpower can survive on Hersheys chocolate is beyond me.
