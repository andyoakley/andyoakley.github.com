Things went downhill quite rapidly this evening. Nick was particularly ill last night, asked if I could find him a replacement for tomorrow morning's outing, but then decided he'd be OK. About 22.30, he had a temperature and was throwing up again, so we do now have a replacement. Whilst all this was going on, I realised Pete wasn't aware that we had an outing and therefore quite desperately had to find a cox. Anyway, enough of this babble.<br /><p>Lauren is happy with all the women's erg results and she shaved 6s of her PB.<br /><p>I've made some headway on the vCalendar work for my project, which I guess is something.<br /><p>On a different note, it seems the computing service is banning incoming ftp as of next week. Whilst I have indeed fallen foul of hackers by this means before, it does unfortunately mean that <a href="http://www.blogger.com">blogger</a> will stop working until a devise a workaround.
