title: Fixing the VGA projector problem in Windows 7 on a MacBook Air 
---

I've had a MacBook Air for the better part of a year now and been very pleased. With Bootcamp it's trivial to install and run Windows 7 and it's been one of the most reliable, predictable laptops I've had to date.

In fact, my only real complaint -- and it's a big one -- has been the low success rate when using the standard Apple Mini DisplayPort to VGA adapter with the various projector configurations at work. A majority of the time the machine simply won't drive the external display.

Finally, thanks to a [thread](https://discussions.apple.com/thread/2784143?start=30&tstart=0) on apple.com, I discovered a pointer to the [Cirago Mini DisplayPort to VGA Active Adapter (DPA2011)](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B005AT2KTK/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=andyoaklecom-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B005AT2KTK)

I'm delighted to report a 100% success rate so far!
