It happened so fast. Today we took a trip a little out of town (still at Byron Bay) to <a href="http://www.skydivebyronbay.com/">Sky Dive Byron Bay</a>. After getting all strapped up and ready to go, I hopped into a tiny plane with another girl and two cameramen and we were on our way. The climb took a little while - beautifully clear sky and great views of the bay being replaced with just a few thin clouds just before 14000ft. Jumping from a moving plane at altitude is the biggest rush you can imagine - the rushing wind, the freedom of movement and the unbelivable view are all a factor, but the fact that you're simply hurtling towards the ground without restraint is simply crazy. And then, 10000 feet and 70 seconds later, the parachute deploys and everything is tranquil.When's the next flight?
