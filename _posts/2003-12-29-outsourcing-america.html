The <a href="http://www.newmillenniumresearch.org/event-02-25-2002/jobspaper.pdf">employment multiplier effect</a>:<blockquote>This phenomenon is referred to as an employment multiplier effect. The employment multiplier measures the number of indirect jobs created for every direct job. Employment gains from IT investments cascade throughout much of the economy, creating a sizable stimulus to economic growth. While the multiplier effects from deploying a next-generation broadband network should exceed those found in the general economy (estimated to be around 1.5 to 2.0), it is likely to be less than the multiplier effects attributed to Microsoft (estimated to be 6.7).</blockquote>The rest of the tech sector is estimated at about 4.0. Lou Dobbs has been doing an `Exporting America' segment on CNN over the last few weeks claiming outsourcing will bring about the end of the US economy. It makes you wonder.
