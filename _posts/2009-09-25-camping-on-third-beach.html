Back in August a group of friends headed out to the far west coast of the Olympic Peninsula to Third Beach. Despite a light drizzle on the evening of our arrival the weather picked up as the weekend progressed. There is no shortage of driftwood on the beach and armed with a heavy ax we built a substantial shelter and impressive bonfire. Fun weekend.
