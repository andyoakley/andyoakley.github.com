Been a bit busy since the New Year but things are finding order again. Plenty to report but I'll save that for another time.Meanwhile, one of the coolest things I've heard in ages:<blockquote>A Danish biotech company has <a href="http://story.news.yahoo.com/news?tmpl=story&amp;cid=585&amp;e=1&amp;u=/nm/20040127/sc_nm/arms_denmark_landmines_dc">developed a genetically modified flower</a> that could help detect land mines and it hopes to have a prototype ready for use within a few years... The genetically modified weed has been coded to change color when its roots come in contact with nitrogen-dioxide (NO2) evaporating from explosives buried in soil... Within three to six weeks from being sowed over land mine infested areas the small plant, a Thale Cress, will turn a warning red whenever close to a land mine. </blockquote>
