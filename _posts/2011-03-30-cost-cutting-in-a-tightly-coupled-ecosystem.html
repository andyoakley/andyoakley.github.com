Never underestimate how interconnected complex systems can be.

The Federal government continues to rely on a lot of forms and paperwork for day to day business. Many of these forms, particularly for exchanges with individual citizens, are transferred by the regular mail service. Is this indirectly subsidizing the US Postal Service? Efforts to reduce the amount of paperwork may in fact reduce the amount of traffic the USPS moves and therefore lead to reduction in pickup frequencies and delivery routes.

In the winter of 2009,Â RiteAid profits were down as a result of a public awareness campaign on the importance of personal hygiene, washing hands, and staying home when sick. The reduced incidence of colds and flu led to a drop in demand for Kleenex, cold medicine and other over the counter remedies.

What unexpected consequences have your actions had today?
