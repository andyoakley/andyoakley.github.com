Woke up with a fairly mild hangover this morning. Good night last night as I recall.<br /><p>In the bunch of 10 or so e-mails I received this morning, I had one from a crowd called <a href="http://www.smoke4free.co.uk">smoke4free</a> who seem to specialise in selling tobacco seeds for personal cultivation. Can't see it catching on myself (although they claim for a Aï¿½20 investment, you get 500 seeds = 5000 cigarettes every year).<br /><p>More rowing hassles with people not able to make things. Such is.
