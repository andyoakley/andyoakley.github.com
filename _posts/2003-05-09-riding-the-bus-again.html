It was always going to be hard to live up to yesterday's excitement, especially when you spend 9 hours on the road. We caught the McCafferty's bus at 6.55 this morning to Hervey Bay where we're now <a href="http://www.yha.org.au/hostels/details.cfm?hostelid=136">staying</a> for a night. The trip to Fraser Island tomorrow promises 'guaranteed 4WD' while touring over the massive sandbar that is the island and if we're really lucky we might see a dingo or man-eating shark or ten (thanks LP). Unfortunately we don't have time to spend the night there, so it's back to Hervey Bay and on another night bus up to Airlie Beach tomorrow night.None of the internet places let you download pictures from a camera, so unfortuantely the piccies are going to have to wait.
