Got up at 6.30 again this morning, I tihnk that some of us are actually getting used to getting up this early. The morning jobs seem to be coming almost routine as the team splits into sub-teams and sets of to accomplish their own little jobs of fetching water, collecting food, cooking or washing up.

By this time in the first trek we have realised that because of the terrain there is n way we are going to make Sandrakaley by Sunday on foot. So, we are now planning to walk to Fiandanana and arrive there as early as possible on Sunday, then organise transport to Sandrakaley. Nanah informs us that there is someone there with a car which will fit 15 people in.

We set off walking later than originally proposed and again the terrain started off being very difficult especially for our growing number of walking wounded. However we pressed on and at lunch time we were rewarded with being allowed to have lunch by a river providing us with an opportunity to have a wash and wash some clothes.

Setting off refreshed and filled up after lunch we started to cover more distance over slightly easier terrain and arrived at Ambaro on the village football pitch. It was here where some of us and Jean-Pierre, the intrepid guide got our first bit of frisbee playing in since the build up.

The locals here were fairly imposing, and had to be asked to move by Nanah while we ate. AFter dinner most of us just sat around talking, looking at the moon through binoculars and looking for interesting and humorous shapes in the clouds before retiring to bed for a refreshing and good nights sleep.
