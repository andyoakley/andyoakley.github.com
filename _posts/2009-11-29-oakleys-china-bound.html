Starting in mid January of next year, Amy and I are planning to be in Beijing, China for about five months. To make that happen there is much to be done in the next six weeks: from visas to travel plans and accommodation, also planning work projects and picking the right clothes, all while figuring out what to do with cars and other commitments here and how to spend our time while we're there.

Exciting times ahead!
