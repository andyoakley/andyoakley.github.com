I still suck but will suck less as time goes on. Even though we were a little under-represented today, it was a great game and we walked away with a handsome six point victory. Well done us.</p> <p><a href="http://www.underdogseattle.com/Kickball/Standings.asp?leaguechoice=488">Standings</a></p> <p>Update: Apparently we won 14-8, not 12-8. </p>
