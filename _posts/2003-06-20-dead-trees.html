You notice some odd things when living in a building with 400 other people. Take phone directories - it's that time of year when both the yellow and white pages come out and they're all sitting there in the lobby for the taking. A veritable coppice of cheap grade paper, just waiting to gather dust for the coming year. How novel it will be, explaining to people in years to come how we once used these books to find everyday information.
