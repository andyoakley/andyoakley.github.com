Will the economics of spam change?  Maybe some <a href="http://www.msnbc.com/news/927809.asp?0sl=-32">high profile lawsuits</a> will help. Certain hardcore spammers seem to be getting quite enterprising - block them from Messenger, and they send e-mail asking why they've been blocked - so I doubt this'll really change their habits. Still, if it raises consumer awareness (when people finally discover you can't really gain 6 inches over the internet), maybe conditions will change.I have to credit the guy who's sending his resume out as mass spam saying 'I'm not sure if this is the right address'. Nice try, but don't hold your breath.
