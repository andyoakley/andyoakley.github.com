Comfortable sofas, good coffee, relaxed atmosphere, all very good. But it doesn't stop there.</p><p>I recently discovered a <a href="https://www.starbucks.com/card/default.asp">Starbucks card</a> in my car, a corporate gift or some such. This is the deal - you get a magnetic-strip card precharged with $5 that works just like cash. You order your drink, hand over the card, it gets swiped and returned - no signature, no change. What's special about that? Well, it's convenient, but the real magic is the automatic recharge - when your balanced drops below a threshold and it can automatically be topped up from a credit card, again, no signature, no hassle. I'm hooked; I've always had a Starbucks problem, but they've really got me this time, it's just too damn convenient.</p><p>The original logo is still there at the first location by Pike Place Market, which incidentally is one of the eight outlets in a three block radius from here.</p></p>
