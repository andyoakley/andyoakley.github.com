Katie has just finished reading the 'Life of Pi' and we're at an impasse around its symbolism and underlying meaning. Google provides <a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;q=&quot;life+of+pi&quot;+symbolism+meaning">little in the way of assistance</a>; my suspicion being that folks are discouraged from stating their own interpretation given the slating the book received by the world of professional reviewers. I enjoyed the text when I first read it and�will probably�re-read it fairly soon, hopefully with my take on it to follow.
