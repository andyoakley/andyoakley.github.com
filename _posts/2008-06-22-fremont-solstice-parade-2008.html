Every year, Seattle welcomes the advent of summer with the Fremont Solstice Parade. The Fremont Arts Council -- which incidentally has the fabulous tag line 'Fremont is a state of mind' -- describes the event as follows:
<blockquote>An unparalleled demonstration of free speech, creativity, art and community, we cast a spell of joy, hope and rebirth that spreads from Fremont to the entire universe. We welcome wild, weird, engaging, surprising, delightful, beautiful, collaborative, innovative art of all stripes.</blockquote>
This year <a href="http://www.theochocolate.com/">Theo Chocolate</a> put together a Mayan theme entry complete with huge snake, Aztec headdresses and some very popular chocolate-covered ladies. Alongside Batman, the Flying Spaghetti Monster, Uncle Sam on stilts, karate dancers doing back flips barefoot, full orchestras on hand-drawn floats and a whole block full of dancers in pink, the event pretty much sums up everything great about Fremont in a single afternoon.<a title="fremont solstice parade 2008 100 by Andy Oakley, on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/apoakley/sets/72157605757663854/"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3150/2602667358_f89cedbca8.jpg" alt="Start of the Fremont Solstice Parade" width="500" height="333" /></a>More pictures in <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/apoakley/sets/72157605757663854/">Andy's Fremont Solstice Parade 2008 photo set</a>
