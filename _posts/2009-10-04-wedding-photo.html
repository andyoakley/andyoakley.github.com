Amy and I got married a couple of weeks ago at Fort Worden State Park in Port Townsend, Washington. We had a great time, everything went smoothly, and it was very special to have so many family and friends in one place together.

Holly Strand with <a href="http://www.beautifulendings.com/">Beautiful Endings</a> did an absolutely fabulous job with the pictures. She was great throughout the day, clearly passionate and excited by what she was doing, considerate to the hectic sequence of the day and thoughtful of things that can easily get overlooked (like eating!), all while being almost invisible as she went about capturing some great shots. I would strongly recommend her.
