<p>Shamelessly borrowed:<br /><i>Looking for a guy on the internet: $50/month<br />Talking to a guy LD every night on the phone: $80/month<br />Falling in love: priceless.</i></p><p>I'm intrigued as to how anyone can find love on the internet, I just don't feel the medium is conducive to it. Still, there's plenty of evidence to suggest otherwise. A wise one once told me 'everyone on the internet is a man'; a sobering thought.</p>
