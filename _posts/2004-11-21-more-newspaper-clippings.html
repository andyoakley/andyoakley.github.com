A little bit late, but from the front page of The Stranger, Nov 11: <blockquote>Do not despair.<br />You don't have to leave.<br />You don't have to move to Canada.<br />You may feel out of place in the United States today.<br />You may feel like you're surrounded by fundamentalist-church-going, gun-hugging, gay-bashing, anti-choice Bush voters.<br />But you're not. George W. Bush only got 51% of the national vote.<br />And you don't really live out there somewhere in &quot;the Nation,&quot; do you?<br />You live in the city.<br />A big city. And John Kerry got 61% of the urban vote.<br />The bigger the city, the higher Kerry's percentage.<br />John Kerry got 80% of the vote in Seattle.<br />Cities vote democratic. Cities are the economic engines that power this country.<br />Cities are diverse, dynamic, and progressive.<br />Don't think of youself as a citizen of the United States. You are a citizen of the urban archipelago.<br />The United Cities of America. </blockquote>
