    We've been very fortunate to have a couple of weekends of stunning weather. Cold, crisp, clear and icy. Great for hiking (last weekend) and skiing (tomorrow, hopefully). Last Sunday, Amy and I hit up a random FS road off I-90 around milepost 34.

This isn't actually my truck but the driver had done a rather good job of lodging it in a rut caused by a landslide. The road seemed blocked at this point but there were quite a lot of vehicles beyond. As we rolled up there was a tow truck blocking the way although it wasn't exactly obvious what help he could bring. We parked up and hiked on by instead. By the time we returned, the truck and occupants were gone.
