Despite the weather (which would be considered dismally rainy at any lower altitude) we had a fun day. Lauren's confidence on the skis came back pretty quickly while I got ahead of myself at times, still can't quite figure out how to land a jump.</p><p>I've also discovered the need for wax and maintenance.

I'd love to head up there again next weekend, it would be a shame for the season to just end again as it seemed to last year, but things are looking rather busy at the moment.</p>
