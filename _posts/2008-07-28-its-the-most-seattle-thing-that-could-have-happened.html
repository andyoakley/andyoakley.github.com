It's hard to know exactly what transpired during the <a href="http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/localnews/2008075512_reading27.html">altercation at the Critical Mass event this weekend</a>, accounts seems to vary depending on who is talking. I did enjoy reading the <a href="http://slog.thestranger.com/2008/07/the_driver_speaks">driver's point of view</a> however:
<blockquote>While a some cyclists I’ve spoken with have written Mark off as another indignant road-hog, Mark says <strong>he actually used to be a bike commuter </strong>when he lived in Seattle a few years ago. “I sympathize with [cyclists’] cause. I ride bikes too. I’m a liberal hippie democrat,” he says, adding “I’m gay, the person with me was a lesbian and we were a attacked by eco-terrorists. <strong>It’s the most Seattle thing that could have happened.</strong></blockquote>
