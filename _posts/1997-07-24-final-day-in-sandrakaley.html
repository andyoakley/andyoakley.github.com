And so it came to pass that the good villagers of Sandrakaley bid us a fond farewell with a plate of bananas and the invitation - once again - to make fools of ourselves accompanied by the village's very own popular beat combo.

The versatile group of minstrels performed - at our demand - a greatest hits set which was received rapturously by he enthusiastic audience and when the mighty riff of the epic number, Monique, issued forth from the well used instruments we took the opportunity to entertain the villagers through the medium of dance.

Forgetting the abject failure of our attempts at both dancing and singing the previous night and the fact that we were now stone cold sober, but showing that great British enthusiasm and resilience we set about publicly humiliating ourselves in an attempt not to have our efforts superceeded by an altogether more competant, but nonetheless foreign opposition.

Sam with his all-encompassing, in fact, Mr Tickle-esque limbs proved to be a source of great entertainment as he writhed, twisted and girated before an entranced audience however, spontaneous combustion would perhaps have proved a more exciting, impressive and constructive alternative to our somewhat lacklustre efforts at song and dance.

Indeed, Sam appeared to have undergone an amazing transformation from an ordinary schoolboy to a wildly vibrating magician in posession of hypnotic powers. Unfortunately, all good things must come to a hideously embarassing climx and with the end of Sam's masively popular eratic prancing routing came the advent of white man singing.

In an effort to save face, we took a dogmatic tone, raised our voices to the heavens and treated the assembled gatherers to a rendition of Jerusalem. Sadly, our attempt to make their African island seem inferior to our 'green and pleasant land' was greeted with modest indifference! However, morale must not suffer with our inept performance; we are British, we brought the art of queuing to the world, we won the World Cup 31 years ago and we have to teach those who fail to recognise our status to show some respect.
