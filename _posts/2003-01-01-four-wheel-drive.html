<p><p>Only a moderate hangover this morning, so I decided to go and pick up my car from Sean's and head out to <a href="http://www.summitatsnoqualmie.com">Snoqualmie</a>. The journey, usually about an hour, took almost three, mostly sitting stationary on I-90 watching fools implement that well-informed technique 'really rev it up in the snow, the car is sure to move'. And move it does, backwards, around, anywhere but forwards. As usual, I took great delight in seeing the ridiculously large SUVs flailing hopelessly because the owner clearly bought the vehicle for the image and decided 4WD really wasn't worth the cost.</p><p>With all that over, I enjoyed a fantastic few hours - 8&quot; new snow today so lots of powder, and the slopes were empty. Getting a lot better on the snowboard too.</p><p>However, I made a horrible discovery when it came time to leave. On the CR-V, four wheel drive only engages going forwards! Having parked head in towards a snowdrift with cars close on both sides, it was looking bad. Using an umbrella to excavate trenches for the front tires wasn't precisely how I planned to end the day, but it seemed to do the trick anyway.</p></p>
