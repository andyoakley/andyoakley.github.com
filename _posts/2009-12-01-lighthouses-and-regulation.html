A while back I came across the guide to the <a href="http://www.scribd.com/doc/7118699/30-FSO-RegGuide">Foreign Service Office Selection Program</a>. The sample questions are fun to try at home and one in particular caught my eye:
<blockquote>All of the following are examples of United States products that would typically fail to be produced to optimal output without government intervention EXCEPT:

A. national defense products
B. light provided by lighthouses
C. new automobiles
D. new highways</blockquote>
The correct answer is C, which makes sense when you look at the competition in that marketplace. (How this question applies to GM/Chrysler is perhaps a slightly different matter these days...)

The interesting part for me was the lighthouses. Who knew.
