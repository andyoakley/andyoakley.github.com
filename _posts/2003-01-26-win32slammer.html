<p>It's been a long time with no posts; work has become very hectic of late. With a ship date bought forwards by four months, there's a lot scrambling to be done to make everything happen in time. Nothing like a challenge.</p><p>I'm off to LA tomorrow for a few days vacation, meeting up with Lauren. I'm really looking forward to some time off, and seeing the delights that California has to offer - Disneyland, Hollywood and all.</p><p>The <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/technology/2693925.stm">Slammer</a> attacks of Friday/Saturday have calmed down somewhat, but I imagine it's going to be a busy few days picking up the pieces. It's fascinating to see such a small fragment of information (376 bytes) can have such a profound effect on so many people and businesses, preventing them for accessing the increasingly indepensible internet. True, you could say something earth-shattering with 376 bytes (God doesn't exist, we're all aliens, for example), but it's extremely hard to find a case where the fragment has the same evidence that proves what it says is really true.</p><p>Of course, at the end of the day, it must be Microsoft's fault, so any further discussion is somewhat redundant.</p>
