<p>Freedom of the press is an interesting notion. Although the US takes such values as a matter of pride, there still seems to be scope for interpretation. Who decides which pieces of news are important?</p><p>Consider the unfolding <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/2652773.stm">ricin</a> investigations in the UK. These reports seem to be generating a lot of interest - I find it on the home page of CNN, MSNBC, it's making regular news on those TV stations too, as well as getting a slot on local news here. </p><p>At this instant, I have to navigate to the UK News page of the BBC, where it's listed as the fifth story in the 'Other news' category.  </p><p>Priorities are getting confused somewhere. With the current fear of terrorism, are the news corporations delivering valuable information, or just inciting hysteria? As 'ricin' is currently the most popular search term on MSN, I sadly suspect it's the latter.</p>
