<p>The big race day is fast approaching. I'm flying out to Philadelphia on Friday ahead of Sunday's jog through the streets of New York. I'm not sure what percentage of the 26.2 miles is going to be unpleasant but I'm feeling really excited nonetheless. Bob called this evening and we're all ready to go. He even mentioned that there might be a certain Guy Fawkes night bonfire in Philly on Friday as it will be the fifth of November (remember, remember). Coincidentally, it happens to be that day three years ago that I got on a plane in Manchester and first set foot in the city which I've taken to calling home.</p><p>It was this time last year that I was visiting Bob when <a href="http://andyoakley.com/blog/archive/2003/11/19/Twentysixmilesthreehundredeightyfiveyards.aspx">we decided to run the marathon</a>. On returning to Seattle I set to training at once and brimming with enthusiasm headed to the fitness room. Some twenty minutes and 2.5 miles laterï¿½I was wondering what the hell I'd done. That was it, about as much as I had in me and it was falling a long way short of what I needed. Fortunately, persistance and training can solve these things. Over the last couple of months I've really ramped up with a long 17 mile run (Bothell-Seattle), a twelve mile (over the I-90 bridge into Bellevue) and regular 7 mile post-work exercise. This is a very light week and the three miles this evening seemed positively calm. I've come a long way but still have quite a distance to go.</p>
