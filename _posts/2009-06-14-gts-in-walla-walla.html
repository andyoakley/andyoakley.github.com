This weekend we headed out to Walla Walla in eastern Washington to celebrate the marriage of some friends. The ceremony and reception were in a great location and the evening suited them perfectly. A great occasion.

Some photos from my <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/apoakley/sets/72157619672167519/">Walla Walla trip</a> set on Flickr.

Around Walla Walla:
