Data points I saw in a presentation recently with some of my thoughts inline:

<strong>As late as the 1940s, the product cycle stretched 30-40 years whereas today it seldom lasts 30 to 40 weeks</strong>
The product cycle also includes that phase of 'end of life' which is becoming similarly compressed. In hardware and software, the total lifespan rarely exceeds 4 years. I'm not sure how much this can be compressed but suspect that there's a limit at which the cost of familiarization/installation becomes a meaningful portion of the overall lifespan of the product, at which point it'll essentially flatten out.

<strong>80% of scientists, engineers and doctors who ever lived are alive today</strong>
Population growth makes this a tiny bit misleading but it's still a staggering realization. Â How many of those are in the US? How many 10 years from now?

<strong>All the technical knowledge we work with today will represent only 1% of the knowledge that will be available in 2050</strong>
Again this has to be balanced against the creation of an 'exabyte per day' but by then we'd better be surrounded with better research and mining tools than we have today.

<strong>The half-life of an engineer's knowledge today is only five years. In electronics, fully half of what a student learns as a freshman is obsolete by his or her senior year</strong>
Which is why education in these fields should focus on problem solving and the ability to leverage prior research rather than learning by rote.
