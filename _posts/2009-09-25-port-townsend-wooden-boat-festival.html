With my parents in town ahead of our wedding we made an early trip out to Port Townsend to wrap up some final details and make a trip to the annual Wooden Boat Festival. The weather was stunning for the occasion and the mix of boats, big and small, and of many different styles and backgrounds was impressive to see. It's refreshing to see so much energy, excitement and enjoyment around an interest like this.
