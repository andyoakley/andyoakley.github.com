Day five ended up being a fairly low key affair for me. I was happy to get a few good runs in and finish the trip uninjured before lunch. A final soak in the tub followed by lunch in Dusty's and it was only a couple of hours before we were using up our last loose change in the Longhorn bar. We ate beef stroganoff and finished up the night with a game of poker. Our plans for night-time sledging down to the bar will have to wait until next year.<br /><br />Dave and I got back to Seattle for lunch (no problems at the border!) and like that, brother was passing through security to board his flight back to London.<br /><br />Tuesday was a crazy hectic day at work but that was to be expected.
