In the last six months I've re-stumbled upon a resource I've had for a long time but have little used: <a href="http://my.safaribooksonline.com/">O'Reilly's Safari Books Online</a>. While reading books in a web format is really no substitute for holding a bound paper volume in your hands, it does make it far easier to taste books that might otherwise get skipped.

Most recently, I've been spending some time reading <a href="http://www.thedambook.com/">The DAM Book</a>. By one means or another I've generally managed to work out systems for storing data that seem to hold up for a while but when you're talking about preserving things for potentially 50 years in digital format, there's no harm in taking a look into how others are doing it. I learned quite a few things that I do plan to incorporate into my habits including a systematic workflow, copious tagging, rating and flagging and DNG conversion. I would recommend the book.

Aside: I graduated college with 2,000 pictures which was, to me, mind-blowing, mainly because the memory card in my Fujifilm DX-7 filled up around at around 25 640x480 images and each set drained a full charge of four AA batteries. These days I'm somewhere north of 15,000 and the pace of acquisition is only increasing.
