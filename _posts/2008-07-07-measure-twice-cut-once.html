<p>When I first moved into my house, the basement was a large, unfinished space of 1200 sq ft lit by two 60W bulbs. Not the most inviting of places but it presented much opportunity. In last year, I've undertaken a number of projects including removing the lowered ceiling tiles, replacing the plumbing, rerouting the electrical wiring, adding lights and building out an office. </p> <p>Over this last three day weekend, Amy and I got down to some more serious work with rerunning of duct work, framing in some interior walls and setting up a lot of shelving and storage space. All great progress but there remains much to be done - more framing, electrical, hanging drywall, flooring and painting. </p> <p>And boy am I impressed by the people that do this day in and day out.</p> <p><a href="http://blufiles.storage.msn.com/y1poTRUmE3T63jz4AEaCMWWS4X1GBf_LVPnQAuA9ftM82uGU78sM-C7H1zgSBIhaLa1?PARTNER=WRITER"><img style="border-right:0;border-top:0;border-left:0;border-bottom:0;" height="244" alt="image" src="http://blufiles.storage.msn.com/y1pA-u3Ce8lpcXGjnd-9D6DTnHu0Ky-nICYSyybGYOQZn28KtAAUOn1NqqwXW0zKoLZ?PARTNER=WRITER" width="181" border="0"></a></p>
