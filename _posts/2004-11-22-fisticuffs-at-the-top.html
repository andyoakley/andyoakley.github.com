<p>Maybe it's the time of year. First the NBA falls into disrepute when a handful of players decide to take a mid-game�excursion into the stands�for a <a href="http://www.newsday.com/sports/basketball/ny-spartest224051717nov22,0,7431043.story?coll=ny-top-headlines">quick bout with some fans</a>. Not wanting to feel left out, now it seems the President�decides he wants in on some action too, <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/ac2/wp-dyn/A2550-2004Nov21?language=printer">'saving' on his Secret Service agents from a scuffle</a>. All politics aside, I find the latter story rather amusing. The media is looking for a scandal here but this sounds like fair game to me. Memories of�the entertaining <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/vote2001/hi/english/newsid_1335000/1335927.stm">Prescott Punch</a> in 2001 come to mind (as well as all of the infuriating follow-up) but I think this one will just fade away.</p>
