I've taken to listening to international radio stations on <a href="http://www.shoutcast.com">Shoutcast</a> of late. The content of the airwaves gives a surprisingly vivid impression of the current culture and humor in the areas they broadcast from. Some of the French and Spanish ones are quite cool to listen to and some from Japan are truly bizarre.Today it was Virgin Radio. I heard some tunes from a chap called Robbie Williams and a band by the name of Queen, two things I've not heard in a long time.Off to Boston tomorrow morning for a <a href="http://www.jupiterevents.com/blog/spring03/registration.html">conference</a>.
