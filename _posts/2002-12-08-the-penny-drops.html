<p>The phrase 'the penny drops' describes that instant when all of a sudden, what was a complete mystery becomes completely obvious. While thinking about this recently, it struck me that there is a similar, yet opposite case, which occurs when one sees a totally different meaning in something taken as understood. For reasons that I suspect are chemical, the sense of dawning realization is identical for both.</p><p>Take the phrase 'united we stand, divided we fall' (apparently the motto of <a href="http://www.50states.com/kentucky.htm">Kentucky</a>, amongst other things). For a long time I <i>knew</i> this meant 'when things are good, we stick together, but don't expect any help when things get bad'. Yes, indeed, I was probably the only person on the planet to misinterpret that one, but it still seems like a reasonable meaning to me.</p><p>The same goes for the line 'The Wombles of Wimbledon Common are we!' from <a href="ftp://ftp.kanga.nu/pub/users/claw/odd/womble/womble.wav">Wombling Along</a>. For at least 10 years, I was convinced there was a line break right there in this song about plebian Wombles. As a side note, I was absolutely delighted to discover Google has a <a href="http://directory.google.com/Top/Regional/Europe/United_Kingdom/Arts_and_Entertainment/Television/Programmes/Children's/Wombles,_The/?tc=1">directory entry</a> for this, granting the respect it deserves.</p>
