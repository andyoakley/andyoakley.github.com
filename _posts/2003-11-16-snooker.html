Good to spend a weekend in Seattle again. A little get-together at my apartment last night resulted in a decision to go to the Zoo Tavern, the place 'with that massive pool table'.On arrival, it was clear some education was in order. This was no pool table, it was a snooker table. All those red balls and tiny pockets posed a challenge that couldn't be turned down and, almost an hour later, with scores barely breaking twenty, the game was complete.I'm reminded why I prefer pool.
