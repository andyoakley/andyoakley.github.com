<p>While the debate on the war in Iraq rages on, I just heard a fascinating panel discussion on MSNBC.</p><p>Paraphrasing<br /><div><i>(on the preparations for the war in Iraq)</i><br />I have an interesting quote. &quot;It is my intent to prepare this country for unconditional military willingness and military readiness&quot;. Do you agree with that?<br /><i>Yes</i><br />Do you know who said that? <b>Hitler said that</b>.<br /></div></p><p>While it is probably somewhat unfair to compare the Bush administration to Hitler, it does raise a very interesting point.</p><p>There's something very wrong with sunrise at 7:52. I'm sure it never used to be this late.</p>
