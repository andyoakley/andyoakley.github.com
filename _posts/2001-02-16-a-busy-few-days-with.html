A busy few days. With Emily and Garan, we raced in the <a href="http://www-stud.robinson.cam.ac.uk/rcbc/binsonhead/results.html">Robinson Head</a> on Friday and came a respectable 4th. As expected, the race gave us a good measure against the other crews, although there was quite a margin between us and the leaders. Sadly the second and third boats both had to scratch due to lack of crew members.<br /><p>Today was <a href="http://www-stu.pem.cam.ac.uk/~boats/regattas/01regres.htm">Pembroke Regatta</a> and good fun at that. We easily beat <b>Christs</b> in the first round and came against <b>Caius</b> in the next. Coming under the railway bridge, we clashed blades as Caius came off their station and due to an incompetant marshal, a re-row was required. A good race ensued and we lead to the line, whereupon Caius managed a last few good strokes and won by a bow-ball. 1st and 3rd proceeded to beat Caius by a similar margin. These good results show a lot of promise. The 1st women easily won, and look set to do very well in the Lents.
