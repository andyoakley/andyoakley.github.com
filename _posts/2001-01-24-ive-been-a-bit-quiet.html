I've been a bit quiet on the blog from recently. <br /><p>Tuesday night was Bob's &quot;birthday&quot;, and a thoroughly entertaining evening. Just formal hall, the bar and plenty of alcohol.<br /><p>On the rowing front, everyone seems to be getting injured or ill, which is bad. Everyone is doing an erg tests, and the results range from scarily pleasing to outright disgraceful. James got 6:50 which is certainly setting a standard for me to follow. Denis was at a wine tasting last night, and plans to his today as well.<br /><p>I've got loads done on my <a href="http://lookout.splo.sh">project</a> in the past couple of days and I think I'll be looking to start writing it up fairly soon.
