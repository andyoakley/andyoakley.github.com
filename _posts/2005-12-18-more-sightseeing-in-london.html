<p>More fun with sightseeing at the palace, the Houses or Parliament and�Westminster yesterday. I'll try and post some photos once I get a real connection outside of an internet cafe. (I'm not sure that �1 for 30 minutes is a good deal, but with no connectivity otherwise, it's well worth it).</p><p>It was great to meet up with Garan and Sara for dinner and to catch up.</p><p>Dave and I are headed back to Stoke together this afternoon on the fancy new high-speed train that only takes an hour and a half. It'll be good�to get home.</p><p>Update: <a href="http://www.andyoakley.com/mypictures/Default.aspx/Sightseeing in London (Dec 2005)">Sightseeing in London</a></p>
