With its bold architecture and many varied pieces of military hardware from tanks to planes to ships, the Beijing Military Museum was a great place to tour on a Sunday morning. I especially liked the building itself with its great hangar-like open spaces, large staircases with marble floors and ample natural light. The limited English signage removes almost all of the guilt of not stopping to read everything and leaves little opportunity to question the different ways of preserving history.
