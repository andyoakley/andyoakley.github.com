Several weeks ago I got a random message through Flickr saying that one of my photos had been selected for consideration in the <a href="http://www.schmap.com/seattle/home/">Schmap Seattle Guide.</a>

The photo in question made its way onto the <a href="http://www.schmap.com/seattle/sights_pioneersquare/p=39963/i=39963_47.jpg">Smith Tower</a> page and was taken during last year's Seattle Fire Festival. You can see the <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/apoakley/2662627994/">full picture on flickr</a> or below.

It turns out they use tens of photos per landmark so my inclusion wasn't exactly award-worthy. But I'm still a little proud.
