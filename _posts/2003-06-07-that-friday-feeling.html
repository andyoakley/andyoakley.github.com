It's Friday again, a whole week has gone by since last weekend, and I ponder, what have I acheived? I can see how this question easily weighs on, even demoralizes, many folks and I wonder if I am among them. Well, yes and no. When it's hard to put metrics to a day job, it becomes incredibly difficult to establish progress, let alone self-standing. Right now, I have fewer things to do than I did on Monday, perhaps that's an indication of a good week. Everything seems to be taking shape on schedule, perhaps that's an indication of a good week. I've eaten three (generous) meals a day, perhaps that's a good indication of a good week. I've managed to enjoy some of the sun in Seattle, perhaps that's a good indication of a good week. I quite enjoyed this week, perhaps that's a good indication of a good week.In truth, I don't know. Tactics - the short term - are certainly exciting, until the field of strategy becomes apparent. Doing 'this' instead of doing 'that, that and that' to acheive 'this' is starting to appeal.But don't get me wrong; aside from the 95F temperature in my apartment, things are looking good.
