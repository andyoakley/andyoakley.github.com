<div>Qwest Field (pka Seahawks Stadium) was packed to capacity with some sixty seven thousand people this evening, no doubt all eager to get a glimpse of David Beckham and watch a good old game of football. The friendly between Real Madrid and DC United was indeed friendly with a few exciting moments and 1-1 draw.

Fun stuff.</div><div>ï¿½</div><div><a href="http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/sports/2003187835_webrealmadrid10.html">http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/sports/2003187835_webrealmadrid10.html</a></div>
