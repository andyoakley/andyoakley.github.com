<p>A paradigm story:<br /><div>There is a man at home. There is is a man wearing a mask. There is a man coming home.</div></p><p>What's going on here? Well, the answer depends on who you're asking. The typical answer is a robbery in progress or similar. However, ask a construction worker, they'll speak of home extension and improvement by contractors. Ask a sports player, they'll think of a game of baseball.</p><p>It all comes down to the rules by which we understand and reason about the world and the things within it. And that is a paradigm.</p>
