<p>I just received an MSNBC alert 'Breaking news: <br />U.S. soldier shot dead' which, while certainly tragic, does reflect changing attitudes to conflict and war. Looking back at almost all military engagements in the past, fatalities were expected and accepted as part of the event.</p><p>It's interesting to see how things are changing. Public opinion now demands a zero loss encounter and it's headline news when something goes wrong. The US approach of using expensive 'intelligent' munitions from afar certainly has it's benefits; I have to agree that several $60k <a href="http://www.fas.org/man/dod-101/sys/smart/jdam.htm">JDAM</a>s are worth the cost when considered alongside sending people into harms way at the outset.</p><p>Although it may sound like it, I'm not actually condoning war, but I do believe steps are being made in the right direction to avoid it altogether.</p>
