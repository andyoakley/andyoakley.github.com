<p>Just a few other items of note.</p><p>On Ed's recommendation, this summer I wrote a list of things I'd like to achieve in the next year. I've turned this list (previously scrawled on a BA napkin) in a list of <a href="/default.aspx?id=52">things to do</a> here.</p><p>My American <a href="http://www.sandbox.com">Fantasy Football</a> team achieved the impossible this week, beating the #1 ranked Gigantic Orange 104-67, to stand at 6-6. Thanksgiving tomorrow, so more football on TV then.<br /></p><p>One thing I forgot to mention at the time, I bought <b>gottheskills.com</b> a couple of weeks ago. After the line from an old favorite song (Heaven is a halfpipe by OPM), I was surprised yet delighed to receive a phone call from a company in Houston several days later offering me $500 for the domain. I think I'll hold on to this one, could come in useful some day.</p>
