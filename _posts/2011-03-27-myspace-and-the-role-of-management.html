Scoble recently published some interesting insights on the health of MySpace and the <a href="http://scobleizer.com/2011/03/24/myspaces-death-spiral-due-to-bets-on-los-angeles-and-microsoft/">primary causes behind its decline</a>. Top of that list: betting on the Microsoft stack and being based in LA.Â I won't comment much on the Microsoft side of things other than to say that there are plenty of high volume, high complexity sites -- Bing, MSN, Hotmail, Windows Live, and Xbox Live -- which are all doing just fine. Even with little knowledge of the specific situation to make any meaningful assessment, I suspect there is more to it.

Meanwhile, Todd Hoff, over at the excellent High Scalability blog, had an <a href="http://highscalability.com/blog/2011/3/25/did-the-microsoft-stack-kill-myspace.html">good summary of the subsequent discussion</a>. There were a few themes that jumped out to me:
<ul>
	<li>Don't outsource are (or should be!) your core competencies. You're left with nothing.</li>
	<li>Access to talent (geography and willingness to work for you) is critical. People are what make things happen in this industry.</li>
	<li>Technical debt will kill you. Developers respond to incentives so if hygiene isn't a priority it'll never get addressed. And it gets harder and harder the longer it goes untreated.</li>
	<li>Technical management is vital. If leadership doesn't understand the downside and technical implications of their decisions, big problems lie ahead.</li>
</ul>
Interestingly, few of these mistakes can be attributed to poor coding, platform or architecture decisions, they're much further upstream than that.
