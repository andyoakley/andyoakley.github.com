<p>Internet search is undoubtedly one of the key tools of the knowledge worker these days. For many years now Google has been my home page of putting masses of information at the fingertips. Today two changes big things happened. Google announced they almost doubled their set of indexed pages to 8 billion (crazy) while MSN released an update at <a href="http://beta.search.msn.com">http://beta.search.msn.com</a>. This site is #1 for my name on the new MSN Search so it certainly scores some early vanity points. Interestingly the result sets returned from the two are quite different; I guess time will tell which has the better relevancy ranking.</p><p>All this and I'm still amazed that people average about 1.9 search terms per query.</p>
