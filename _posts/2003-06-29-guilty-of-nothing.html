Sean has been trying to get me to start playing <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/games/ageofmythology/greek_home.asp">Age of Mythology</a> for ages now and I finally crumbled. It only took an hour for me to remember why I don't buy these games - it's a question of addiction. I would have carried on at 4.30am this morning had the body been willing. I have achieved so little this weekend I'm proud.
