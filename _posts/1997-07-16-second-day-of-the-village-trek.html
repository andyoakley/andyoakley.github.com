We got up at 6.30 this morning and had scrambled eggs and crackers for breakfast. We decided to take the shorter route to Sandrakaley which we were told was over slippery ground - we soon found out what the guide meant - sliding down rock faces and scrambling up hills on all fours. It felt like the hills would never end - eventually we came to a village and the sun came out (so did sun hats, sun cream and cameras - the views have been spectacular). Here Suzanne found that she had left her water bottle at the last rest stop and had to run the km there and back to fetch it. We walked through the village slowly with a large audience. The houses had very muddy paths between them and pigs and chickens wandered free range. I don't know what I'm doing wrong but whenever I smile at people they laugh at me!

We stopped for lunch on top of a hill - it was really hot by now and we had soup for lunch! The guides have been invaluable as aids up and down the steep slopes. We did not make our objective that evening but had to stop in a little, muddy village - some of the boys had to sleep in the chief's hut as there was not enough room to pitch all of the tents. The people here have been very interested in us - they stood very close watching everything. Dinner was lovely - pasta and several sauces. We are all dying for a proper wash.
