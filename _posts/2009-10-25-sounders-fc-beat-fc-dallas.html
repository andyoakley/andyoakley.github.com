A couple of years ago Seattle added another professional sports team to its list - Seattle Sounders FC an expansion team in Major League Soccer (MLS). The last serious soccer match I saw was Manchester United playing Chelsea in a summer game in Qwest Field several years ago and before that it must have been Stoke City in Britannia Stadium a long time before. Suffice it to say, it has been a very long time since I'd enjoyed a proper football game.

It was a cool, clear and dry night and the lights of the stadium beckoned.

I was impressed by the level of crowd engagement (quite different from the previous soccer game at the same venue). Singing, chanting, horns, drums and rowdiness behind the goal; just like England. There are still a few subtle differences, however.

The whole lower level of Qwest Field was filled, a record mid-season attendance of more than 33,000 people. Good to see such a level of interest and support.

It was a good game and all the more enjoyable to see the Sounders win 2-1.
