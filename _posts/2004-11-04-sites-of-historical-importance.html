As is often the case, a change encounter in an elevator a couple of weeks ago left me with some interesting historical information. I've lived in downtown Seattle for�a couple of years now without knowing that the Freedman's Loans store I see from my window was the very place Jimi Hendrix bought his first guitar. That whole block on First is looking ripe for demolition and reconstruction but there has been opposition given its 'historical significance'. I'm not sure I buy that but this little nugget certainly deserves a spot in�in the 'interesting footnotes' category.
