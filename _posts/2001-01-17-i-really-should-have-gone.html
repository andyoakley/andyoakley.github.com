I really should have gone by now, but I've got a bit caught up with <a href="http://www.personal.u-net.com/~westwood/ads/p_main.htm">UK Television Adverts</a>. While we're on the topic, some of the MSN one's particularly <a href="//194.128.198.100/msn/Tv1.asf">worm</a> and <a href="//194.128.198.100/msn/Tv3.asf">pamela</a> are duely 'critically acclaimed'. Still can't find the music to the one at the moment though.
