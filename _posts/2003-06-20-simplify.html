Kudos to my mother, who recorded these words from a stone in Mark Laing Nature Parse, Goose Spit, Vancouver Island.<u>Thoughts by Henry David Thoreau</u>Simplify. Don't waste the years struggling for things that are unimportant. Don't burden yourself with possessions. Keep your needs and wants simple, and enjoy what you have. Don't fritter away your life on non-essentials. Don't enslave yourself for luxuries. A man is rich in proportion to the number of things he can do without. Beware of all enterprises that require new clothes.Live in the present, enjoy the present.Simplify your life.Be not simply good, be good for something.Of course, the full wording is there in Thoreau's Walden, but who has time to read books? Maybe I still have a little way to go yet.
