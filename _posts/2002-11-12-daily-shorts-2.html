<p><b>Music</b><br />I really like the song <a href="http://www.gracenote.com/xm/pcd/triphop/c7298485d74a88fa3de0f68d8809bc7d.html">Playground Love</a> by Air from the Levi's commercial at the moment.</p><p><b>Films</b><br />Watched <a href="http://www.imdb.com/Title?0144084">American Psycho</a> this week, very good film.

Thoroughly enjoyed and definitely one I'll read again; I wouldn't say that of many.
