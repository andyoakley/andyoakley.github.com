It's a sure sign you've been in the bar too long when you stand in the cold for thirty minutes absolutely convinced they've simply torn down the shelter and the bus will come around the corner any second. A quick trip to Dicks helped me realize I was waiting on the wrong street and the rest of the journey passed without event. It's that attitude of 'it must be here because here's where I remember it last time I was in the bar' over 'maybe I don't remember perfectly' is precisely why there's a problem with drinking and driving - the definition of 'drink responsibly' changes somewhat during the process of drinking responsibly.
