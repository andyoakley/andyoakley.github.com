While vacations should be relaxing, I'm not one to simply while away days doing nothing in the sun. Back to London once again last weekend for some adventures. Friday morning became Friday afternoon with the most part of The Catcher in the Rye, Friday afternoon became Friday night with some generous Smirnoff blue-label, and Friday night came to a close with dancing in Pop on Oxford Street, and a well-thought-out-on-the-bus plan to visit Paris the following day.Saturday morning came with a certain force at 5.30, just ninety minutes after retiring and having been told a Passport was needed for EU travel. The Italian Passport Agency wasn't much help in telling me that, but thanks to 118 for their thoughtfulness. The trip up to Stoke just to pick up a Passport before the adventure could begin was tempting, but seemed rather wreckless given the impending darkness of a hangover. Paris another day. Instead, Saturday gave several glorious hours of further sleep, some hectic shopping for Christmas presents (a lacking skill, I suspect) and a trip to see Love Actually at the Empire in Leicester Square. Thoroughly enjoyed.And then Sunday. The idea was sound; visit London in the winter time, go ice skating on the rink at Somerset House and feel infused with that inescapable Christmas spirit. Future visitors will be interested to know that such activities require serious planning as tickets are rare. Skating another day. Instead, we happened upon the changing of the horseguards right after getting off the bus and took a stroll through St James Park. The discovery of pelicans and overly tame squirrels in the vicinity of Buckingham Palace made up for any shortfall of frozen ice activity.All in all, a great weekend.
