<p>I've been somewhat busy this last week with the arrival of my parents. They flew in on Wednesday evening and have already discovered a huge amount of Seattle. No work next week, so we'll head slightly further afield and see some of the sights. <a href="http://www.seahawks.com">Seahawks</a> game tomorrow, Mt Rainier on Monday and plenty of other delights in store.</p><p>I was alarmed to read an article today discussing the <a href="http://theregister.co.uk/content/54/28245.html">serious side-effects of laptop use</a>. I'm writing this entry sitting on my couch using a Dell Latitude, so I think I'll keep this entry brief.</p>
