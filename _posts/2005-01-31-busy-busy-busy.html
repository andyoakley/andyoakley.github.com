<p>It's probably a sign that�you've spent too long in the office when you hit 6am Monday morning commuter traffic on the drive home. Still, it was a worthwhile trip and�a couple of hours of sleep made a world of difference. </p><p>Interesting side note: <a href="http://www.gladwell.com">Malcolm Gladwell</a> is in the northwest at the moment promoting his new book. I keep hearing him -- from a spot on NPR, a talk at Microsoft and a televised Town Hall show put on by UofW shown at 6.30am this morning. I thoroughly enjoyed his work on <em>The Tipping Point</em> and from what I've heard his new book, <em>Blink: The Power of Thinking Without Thinking,</em> is going to be equally fascinating. I need to get a copy onto my bookshelf.</p>
