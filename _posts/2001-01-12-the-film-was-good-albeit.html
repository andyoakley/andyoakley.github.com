The film was good, albeit a little strange. Good twist at the end. Sitting here at the moment trying to decide what to do this summer. Two/three months is a long time fill - management consultancy intership? - maybe. Big Brother is auditioning for new contestants soon...<br /><br />I think it's fairly well known that pain numbs with time. Not that I'm feeling any at the moment, but that's the whole point. I wonder if our bodies gradually degrade (over a lifetime) and therefore technically speaking we are always suffering more pain, only we can't feel it. Hmmm. <br />
