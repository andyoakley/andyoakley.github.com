The revelation that Mr Huntington leads a double life proved to be valuable asset to the group. Secretly, the innocent and naive one is in cahootswith a dark and mysterious figure and together they are engaged in an undercover operation to take control of the alcoholic world. Hunto's partner in crime, the excellent Jim, is an unlikely villain: plump, jovial, piggy eyes poking out from an extraordinary (possibly paranormal) pair of eyebrows and piggy mouth poking out from behind an implausible moustache. Jim, with his huge crop of wild, silver curls has none of the obvious markings of a fascist dictator. However, be not deceived.

The vile pair proceeded to tantalise the assembled gatherers with a collection of universally hideous potions. Each so called wine was treated by us, the innocent victims of their power hungry mind experiment, with equal disdain and yet, the tests appeared to have proved successful as, at the end of the evening, the weak minded fools were queuing up to buy the concoctions by the crate-load.

The malicious duo are now loose in society practising their evil ways and so all that remains is for me to reveal the antidote to the brain washing which they perform with nonchalant aplomb. The only method of resistance is the taking up of a brass-band instrument; I'd like to teach the world to swing and save us from the iron rule of a portly connoisseur.
